        <title>Finding a Work Life Balance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You know what’s awesome about Sketch? Quite a lot of things. One of my favorites? Plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I switched over from Photoshop to Sketch as my primary web design tool, I had used Photoshop plugins. However, I often found myself frustrated with how to find, download, install, and generally configure them to get them to do what I wanted. With Sketch, it’s a breeze. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-first-sketch-toolbox&quot;&gt;But First… Sketch Toolbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into my favorite plugins, if you use Sketch and you haven’t installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://sketchtoolbox.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Sketch Toolbox&lt;/a&gt; yet, prepare to get excited. Sketch Toolbox is an amazing application created by members of the Sketch community that lets you easily manage your Sketch plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does three HUGE things for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lets you browse the most popular plugins available for Sketch 
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sketch Toolbox connects directly to GitHub repositories of the latest plugins generated by members of the Sketch community&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Downloads and installs new plugins with a single click
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;No more downloading and moving plugin files around within your app directories. One-click-install and you’re done&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatically keeps all your plugins up to date
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Being connected to a plugin’s GitHub repo means that Sketch Toolbox can simply download the latest sourcecode and keep you up to date&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve got Sketch Toolbox installed, you’ll be rolling with plugins in no time. And now, some of my favorite plugins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sketch-measure&quot;&gt;1) Sketch Measure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynamic-buttons&quot;&gt;2) Dynamic Buttons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s designing a logo for the project, contributing source code, or just adding to the conversation, find the thing you’re most passionate about and contribute. There are also some &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendesign.foundation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opensourcedesign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; you can go to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;side-projects-are-stupid-and-theyre-supposed-to-be&quot;&gt;Side Projects are Stupid… and They’re Supposed to Be&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been looking forward to being introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/schneidertobias&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Tobias van Schneider&lt;/a&gt; (and his luscious beard) for some time. Tobias is a German-born designer that recently led the Spotify brand refresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His talk focused on how keeping side projects focused around fun and stupid ideas helps us from freezing up and over thinking about our work. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://authenticweather.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Authentic Weather&lt;/a&gt; to his own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beardbrand.com/products/black-marble-beard-oil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;line of beard oil&lt;/a&gt;, Tobias has always thought small instead and followed through on some downright silly ideas that have turned into (sometimes viral) side projects. Some guiding principles for successful side projects? Let yourself be stupid, ignore everybody (they all have their own ideas and opinions of how things should be), trust your gut, and stay busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;web-accessibility-is-more-than-accessible-code&quot;&gt;Web Accessibility is More than Accessible Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As practitioners of web design and development, it’s our job to make our websites usable, visually pleasing, and accessible – and that doesn’t mean just developers/engineers implementing accessible code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jennison&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Jennison Asuncion&lt;/a&gt;, Co-Director of the Adaptech Research Network, spoke about how producing accessible content means designing and developing user experiences that everyone, including people with disabilities, can independently consume and interact with. From touching on resources for &lt;a href=&quot;http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;sufficient color contrast&lt;/a&gt; to walking us through the experience of using a screenreader on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/?root=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;United.com&lt;/a&gt;, Jennison got me thinking about how web professionals can (and should) improve accessibility across their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a first web conference experience, it was a blast and extremely inspiring. If you’re a web professional or have just been thinking about putting yourself out there and learning how we creatives can help impact the world around us, I’d recommend attending a conference like FOWD. I’m already planning my next steps of finding and contributing to an open source project, working to make my sites more accessible, and might even be thinking about my own beard oil… well, we’ll see about that last one. Now get out there and get learning!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Switching to Sketch</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I made the switch over from using Photoshop as my primary design tool to using Sketch. At first, the transition was a bit awkward. I found myself lacking in the shortcut department and many times found the simplest things, such as grouping and using layers properly, difficult. However, over time, I began to see the value in having a program built specifically for UI design by web designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my top takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-source-design-is-a-pretty-awesome-thing&quot;&gt;Open Source Design is a (Pretty Awesome) Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk that inspired me the most came from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/garthdb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Garth Braithwaite&lt;/a&gt;, a product designer and front-end developer on PhoneGap at Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garth discussed the benefits of open source design and detailed some of his work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nightscout.info/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;NightScout&lt;/a&gt;, an app developed by parents of children with Type 1 Diabetes to remotely help monitor blood sugar levels (and save lives). By connecting data from a monitoring device called the Dexcom G4, parents can send live updates to their phones and smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His advice for getting into open source? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s designing a logo for the project, contributing source code, or just adding to the conversation, find the thing you’re most passionate about and contribute. There are also some &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendesign.foundation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opensourcedesign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; you can go to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Sourcing My Personal Goals</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2014, I interned as a UX Designer at Viget in Boulder, CO. It was that summer that I (virtually) met fellow intern Una Kravets, who was interning as a front-end developer at Viget’s HQ in Falls Church, VA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our paths crossed, I’ve been following her work (she’s pretty awesome and one of the hardest workers I know), and saw her begin open sourcing her personal goals, both as a way to keep herself accountable and as a means of inspiring others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I was inspired. Often times, it’s difficult to stay disciplined when it comes to what you want to do outside of your normal 9-5 workday. Did you finally read that book on product design techniques? What about that yoga class you’ve been meaning to get to for 4 months? It’s hard. We all find ourselves busy with work and life and more often than not, it’s easier to put off the small things that you’ve been meaning to get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now week three of me having open sourced my goals. I’ve Una’s GitHub repo and am working to make it my own. While I still have a ways to go in organize what I want to do, it’s definitely a start and has got me thinking about the mini accomplishments that can be made each and every day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>To the Future (of Web Design)&lt;br&gt;A Conference Recap</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;A perk of working on a design team at a company like ISL is getting the opportunity to grow both creatively and professionally. Our team has a budget set aside for each designer to attend industry conferences. Recently, I took advantage of the perk and flew myself out to sunny San Francisco to attend the Future of Web Design (FOWD), a 3-day event for designers, front-end developers, and other creatives  working to make the web awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my top takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a first web conference experience, it was a blast and extremely inspiring. If you’re a web professional or have just been thinking about putting yourself out there and learning how we creatives can help impact the world around us, I’d recommend attending a conference like FOWD. I’m already planning my next steps of finding and contributing to an open source project, working to make my sites more accessible, and might even be thinking about my own beard oil… well, we’ll see about that last one. Now get out there and get learning!&lt;/p&gt;

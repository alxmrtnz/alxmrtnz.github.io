http://continuousdelivery.com/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, I’ve been working closely with a team of designers, developers, and project managers at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.serviceyr.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Service Year&lt;/a&gt;, a platform that connects individuals with national service opportunities across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From day one, our team set out to design, build, and iterate withing an agile framework. But what exactly did that mean and, after two years, what does it mean now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-past-terminology&quot;&gt;Get Past Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which industry you may fall into, it makes sense that teams want to work as efficiently as possible to put out the best product they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With articles talking about anything from agile methodology to lean processes to continuous delivery and all of the rises and falls of each, it’s easy to get bogged down by terminology instead of focusing on the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’ve learned anything from our work on Service Year, it’s that design and development processes evolve to suit both the team working on a project and its stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we design, build, test, ship, and iterate on a digital product?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many articles out there proclaiming that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;agile is dead&lt;/a&gt;,” “continuous delivery” is where we’re heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stick-to-principles&quot;&gt;Stick to Principles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it sounds like an ambitious project, it’s because it is. Our team partnered with the Service Year Alliance, to create a source of truth for anyone looking to serve with a nonprofit or other organization in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;never-settle&quot;&gt;Never Settle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When getting started creating anything for the web, it’s easy to think of a project in terms of a linear process. A team is given a problem to solve, the designer creates a solution to that problem, and a developer implements that solution. Your team celebrates the solution’s launch and everyone is happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as we all know, that’s simply not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;never-settle-1&quot;&gt;Never Settle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A designer and hands off to a developer you’ve likely heard of a variety of design processes with some funky names. From waterfall to lean to agile to what may now be a move toward “Continuous Delivery,” being a product designer means figuring out what works best for your team and your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From building a car to producing a website, the waterfall method has long been one of the most popular processes for production industries. Comprised of a discrete series of steps completed in succession, one could say that waterfall is the production line of processes of all work processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, the waterfall method is efficient. There is a clear start and finish to each phase of a project and everyone is on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the realm of digital products, where MVPs (minimum vialable products), user testing, and iteration are used to gauge the success of new features and produce a road map for the product itself, the waterfall method has its flaws. A lack of collaboration and communication between teams members due to a segmented waterfall process can lead to miscommunication, a less successful project, and overall sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-agile&quot;&gt;Enter Agile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A newer methodology, the agile process, aims to fix some of the problems caused by is a process created by software engineers in the early 2000’s that helps teams design, build, and iterate faster than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The need to really complete each feature 100% within each iteration: this can become tiring for both developers and designers. Luckily, building a tight knit relationship with our client allows us to reevaluate and modify processes as needed.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Designing with Agile</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, I’ve been working closely with a team of designers, developers, and project managers at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.serviceyr.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Service Year&lt;/a&gt;, a platform that connects individuals with national service opportunities across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From day one, our team set out to design, build, and iterate withing an agile framework. But what exactly did that mean and, after two years, what does it mean now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defining-the-process&quot;&gt;Defining the Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile is a methodology created by software engineers in the early 2000’s to help teams design, build, and iterate faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The values that make up the process for web projects includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working software over comprehensive documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer collaboration over contract negotiation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responding to change over following a plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, using the agile process means that a team (and its client) defines problems to solve, designs and builds solutions to those problems, tests those solutions with real users, and refines those solutions over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read up about agile &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howdesign.com/editors-picks/dont-go-chasing-waterfalls-agile-web-design/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but in terms of our process on Service Year&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Washington Leadership Academy</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid--featured-image grid--no-bg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full &quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img class=&quot;item-img--full&quot; src=&quot;/assets/work/wla/featured-image-wla.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-overview&quot;&gt;Project Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington Leadership Academy is a public charter school working to change the way we think about high school education. With a mission to provide sutdents in the District of Columbia with the knowledge, skills and habits required for success in college and lives of public leadership, WLA came to our team at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; for a branding and website overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project presented our team with a unique opportunity to create a site from the ground up on Squarespace, design and build a client project in the open, give back to our local community, and help lead the way for a new kind high school education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-modular-design-system&quot;&gt;Creating a Modular Design System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create a custom Squarespace site that would be easily customizeable and maintainable in the future, our team crafted a set of reusable and modular components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wireframing-and-prototyping&quot;&gt;Wireframing and Prototyping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started the project with the goal of creating 4 to 5 unique template pages. In order to rapidly wireframe and prototype (due to the tight project timeline), I ended up created wireframes using a set of several repeated components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/wla/wla-wireframe-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wireframe of WLA&#39;s Home Page&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half end&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/wla/wla-wireframe-about.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wireframe of WLA&#39;s About Page&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repeated components comprising our initial wireframes evolved through collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;http://heyitsolivia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Olivia Cheng&lt;/a&gt;, our lead developer on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her exploration of Squarespace as a development platform made it clear that we could use Squarespace as a CMS to implement the site on a component by component basis and provide WLA with a more flexible and customizable end experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several internal wireframing workshops to validate the value of each component, I created several &lt;a href=&quot;https://invisionapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Invision&lt;/a&gt; prototypes to share with the client and receive any necessary feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/wla/team-wireframe-workshop1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ISL team wireframing workshop&quot; /&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;img-caption&quot;&gt;We held several internal wireframing workshops to identify reusable components and used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invisionapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Invision&lt;/a&gt; to create interactive prototypes.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;visual-design&quot;&gt;Visual Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I worked through the IA/UX of the project, my colleague &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dribbble.com/thepaleshadow/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;James Bonilla&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously worked with WLA to create a brand for their online and offline presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating the James’s branding into the site, it was at this time that I focused on responsive states of each individual component. I worked closely with our front-end developer to evaluate the design solution for each component and used Github to track our progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full no-shadow&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/wla/responsive-screenshots.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive Blocks&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was important that the site reflect the new brand and also expand upon it. Using the new brand’s cool colors and elegant sans-serif and serif typefaces created a feeling of modern prestige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other elements, such as offset image and text blocks and use of diagonal lines, make the site and the WLA brand feel more dynamic and forward-thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing--developing-in-the-open&quot;&gt;Designing &amp;amp; Developing in the Open&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With approval from the WLA team, we were able to open source both the design and development of the project on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our initial goal was to use Github as an internal tool for collaboration but it also ended up allowing our team to document design and development decisions for future contributors to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-tools-we-used&quot;&gt;The Tools We Used&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;github&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to track each individual component, from design to development, we used Github’s issues feature. Using issues allowed both design and development to add comments, screenshots, and statuses to each component as it made its way through our process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;waffle&quot;&gt;Waffle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we integrated our Github repository with &lt;a href=&quot;http://waffle.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Waffle.io&lt;/a&gt;. Using Github issues and Waffle allowed us to create a Kanban board to track progress and collaborate on each feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full no-shadow&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/wla/waffle-and-github.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshots of Waffle and Github&quot; /&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;img-caption text--centered&quot;&gt;We held several internal wireframing workshops to identify reusable components and used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invisionapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Invision&lt;/a&gt; to create interactive prototypes.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we didn’t love Github enough already, we even took advantage of Github’s wiki functionality to create and delivered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/washington-leadership-academy/wla/wiki/WLA-Squarespace-User-Guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;user guide&lt;/a&gt; to WLA for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This iterative, Kanban style process made it easy for our team to track design and development progress and effectively meet a tight deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fin-tip top-margin-large&quot;&gt;	
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
	Takeaways
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From exploring new workflows and processes to iterating on a design at a component-by-component level to furthering my understanding of what it means to collaborate, working on the new WLA site was a very educational and fulfilling experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, we don’t have the opportunity to work on a project that will benefit so many young individuals. WLA has some exciting things in store and if you haven’t already, make sure to check out their &lt;a href=&quot;http://washingtonleadershipacademy.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ISL, we’re constantly exploring ways to take advantage of new technologies. In honor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalpuppyday.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;National Puppy Day&lt;/a&gt;, we created PAW, or “Puppies at Work,” a Slack-integrated tracking system to keep track of dogs in the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project comprised of connecting the physical and digital worlds through a bluetooth tracking system that linked to a web application for viewing the location of dogs in the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an in-depth look at how it works, &lt;a href=&quot;https://isl.co/2016/03/a-slack-based-internet-of-things-iot-tracking-system-for-your-dog-hello-paw/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-overview&quot;&gt;Project Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the latest ISL experiment, PAW was comprised of a small internal team that brought the product to life in a few short weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I served as front-end developer for the public facing marketing page and also helped in the styling of the internal dashboard application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had the opportunity to explore animating SVGs through CSS (thanks to the illustrative work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behance.net/sarahsugarman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Sarah Sugarman&lt;/a&gt;) and worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/krawchyk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Andrew Krawchyk&lt;/a&gt;, the project’s development lead, to implement some of the front-end application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half no-shadow&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/paw/paw-marketing-page-screenshot.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	    
	&lt;/div&gt; 
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half no-shadow end&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/paw/paw-dashboard-screenshots.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;animating-svgs&quot;&gt;Animating SVGs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I began development, I wanted to work on animating the various components of the marketing page’s hero illustration in order to create a playful and interesting experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by exporting three parts of the scene for animation: a coffee mug, the computer screen, and, of course, Watson – our PAW mascot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After combing through the SVG code, I targeted specific shapes for animation and got them moving through the use of CSS animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;p data-height=&quot;750&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;light&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;LGBbOv&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;result&quot; data-user=&quot;alxmrtnz&quot; data-embed-version=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/alxmrtnz/pen/LGBbOv/&quot;&gt;Workspace Animation&lt;/a&gt; by Alex Martinez (&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/alxmrtnz&quot;&gt;@alxmrtnz&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;img-caption&quot;&gt;Animating SVGs through CSS gave the landing page illustration a life of its own.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explored animation loops through relatively simple CSS properties. Elements like the coffee’s steam were particularly interesting because of the need for offset timing to achieve an effect of easing in and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;responsive-development&quot;&gt;Responsive Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to working on SVG animations, my other task at hand was to develop the public-facing marketing page and also to lend support for the internal application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full no-shadow&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/paw/paw-responsive-screenshots.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/paw/paw-homepage-screenshot.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Family Online Safety Institute</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid--featured-image grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/featured-image-fosi.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fosi.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Family Online Safety Institute&lt;/a&gt; (FOSI) came to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; to redesign and rebuild their website. Our mission was twofold — to combine fosi.org and aplaftormforgood.org (now Good Digital Parenting) under one umbrella, and to create a beautiful design and a user friendly experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The redesign process involved diving deep into Google Analytics, conducting user testing with key audiences, and unifying the two sites through detailed wireframing and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working closely with our client, we successfully created a digital hub for online safety news, research, and events. With a focus on information architecture and design, the project aimed to reorganize content and present it in a digestible, mobile-friendly format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-the-audience&quot;&gt;Understanding the Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fosi.org was a challenge due to its wide range of intended audiences. In addition to online safety information for families, the site needed to cater professionals seeking out industry conferences and events to policy makers who utilize FOSI’s many research articles in everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;personas&quot;&gt;Personas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to better understand each type of user, we created a variety personas to serve as references throughout the design process. By working closely with the FOSI team, we could ensure that the personas accurately reflected the intended audiences. We used these personas as a reference for any debates or decisions throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/persona-david.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	    
	&lt;/div&gt; 
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half end&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/persona-mary.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-flows&quot;&gt;User Flows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fictional personas allowed us to create user flows that aided in the identification of discrete goals and actions for each type of user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
    	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-user-flow-david.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;site-structure&quot;&gt;Site Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analyzing user flows and also interviewing stakeholders, we reorganized content into three main buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Family Resources (a.k.a. “Good Digital Parenting”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Policy and Research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reorganization and consolidation of the site’s content makes it easier than ever for each audience to discover what they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full no-shadow&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-sitemap-pt1.png&quot; alt=&quot;FOSI.org Sitemap pt. 1&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full no-shadow&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-sitemap-pt2.png&quot; alt=&quot;FOSI.org Sitemap pt. 2&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototyping&quot;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the functionality we wanted to include in the site, such as a sticky navigation and fixed filters, are often difficult to describe to clients using static wireframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better communicate the small details that would improve the new FOSI experience, our team created a set of animated wireframes in addition to our standard wireframe set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/155266319?autoplay=1&amp;amp;loop=1&amp;amp;loop=1&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-wireframes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FOSI.org Wireframes&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;visual-design&quot;&gt;Visual Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;typography&quot;&gt;Typography&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be inviting to parents, yet authoritative and reliable to professionals, I chose typefaces that mixed organic sans-serif headings with more traditional serifed text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full no-shadow&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-type-example.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aaux-next&quot;&gt;Aaux Next&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaux Next is an approachabe sans-serif that was chosen for headings due to its mix of solid structure and rounded, more quirky, characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minion-pro&quot;&gt;Minion Pro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minion Pro exhibits functional qualities that makes text highly readable. I chose it to give formality and legibility to the site’s main content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;colors&quot;&gt;Colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With content being broken up into several main sections, I defined colors that would be related to each type of content (green for Good Digital Parenting, red for Policy &amp;amp; Research, etc). By tying specific colors to content, we were able to visually separate internal platforms each internal platform and give the user clear context to their location on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full no-shadow&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-colors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fin-tip&quot;&gt;	
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
	A Flexible, Responsive Publishing Platform
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, the new FOSI.org is a multi-faceted publishing platform. From online-safety print outs to the latest research on internet privacy, FOSI works to publish educational content that helps families (and the industry at large) learn and grow in the new digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating flexible layouts, a new design system, and an integration with Wagtail, a Django-based CMS, we were able to provide FOSI with a rethought and redesigned responsive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt &quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-homepage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FOSI.org Homepage&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half no-shadow&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-gdp-tablet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FOSI.org Good Digital Parenting Page screenshot (tablet)&quot; /&gt;
	    
	&lt;/div&gt; 
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half no-shadow end&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-events-phone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FOSI.org Events Page screenshot (mobile)&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Outlook Relationship Management System</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid--featured-image grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/orms/featured-image-orms.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theoutlookgroup.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;The Outlook Group&lt;/a&gt; is one of the nation’s largest marketing firms in the pre-need* funeral industry and has a national team of sales representatives who work with individual funeral homes to maintain and develop their own customer bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with the group and a small team to create the Outlook Relationship Management System (ORMS), a web application that improves the workflow of The Outlook Group’s sales representatives and client funeral homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I focused on establishing the overall visual language and user experience of the platform and also worked closely with project developers throughout implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;
  * pre-need services include things such as pre-need life insurance policies that cover the cost of predetermined expense of a funeral, cremation, or burial.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opportunity-management&quot;&gt;Opportunity Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To allow Outlook Group sales representatives to record and monitor potential customers, we designed a robust opportunities management page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with simple sketches, we were able to validate functionality with Outlook Group stakeholders before moving into visual design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/orms/orms-wireframe-sketches__opportunities.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ORMS Wireframe Sketch - Opportunities Table&quot; /&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;img-caption&quot;&gt;One of our first wireframe iterations for managing customer prospects, leads, and accounts (credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zachkuzmic.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zach Kuzmic&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through iteration, we designed and implemented essential functionality for filtering, searching, and sorting opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/orms/orms-screenshot__opportunities@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;ORMS Application Screenshot - Opportunities Table&quot; /&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;img-caption&quot;&gt;Several iterations of wireframes and visual design led to a robust page for managing sales opportunities.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;task-management-and-collaboration&quot;&gt;Task Management and Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We paid special attention to how Outlook Group sales reps collaborate around individual opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can add and categorize notes in a timeline format for easy future reference, create custom tasks, and schedule appointments that tie into the app’s calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this functionality is available between multiple system users, allowing sales reps to collaboratively record and monitor information on each opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/orms/orms-screenshot__opportunity-detail@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;ORMS Application Screenshot - Opportunity Detail Page&quot; /&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;img-caption&quot;&gt;Users can collaborate on individual opportunities through the use of notes, tasks, and appointments.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;system-vs-custom-tagging&quot;&gt;System vs Custom Tagging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another piece of functionality we were added to ORMS was tagging. ORMS allows users to create custom tags for each opportunity in addition to the base set of tags that Outlook Group admins create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Outlook Tags,” not only help guide their sales reps in the creation of their own custom tags, but also provides valuable usage data to Outlook Group admins for future iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full no-shadow&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/orms/orms-detail__tags.png&quot; alt=&quot;ORMS Application Screenshot - Calendar&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calendar-integration&quot;&gt;Calendar Integration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An in-app calendar that can integrate with any major calendar provider proved an important part of the ORMS system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sales reps and Outlook Group admins needed the ability to track appointments with potential opportunities and current customers. Additionally, admins are able to access employee calendars to help coordinate business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calendar we designed and implemented integrates with Google and allows for everyone within the Outlook Group to stay on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/orms/orms-screenshot__calendar@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;ORMS Application Screenshot - Calendar&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-responsive-visual-system&quot;&gt;A Responsive, Visual System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the project, we focused on creating a responsive web application experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I began the visual design process, I worked on identifying some base styles and flexible components that could be reused across the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full no-shadow&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/orms/orms-detail__responsive@2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;ORMS Application Screenshot - Various Responsive Mobile Screens&quot; /&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;img-caption text--centered&quot;&gt;I worked on creating a responsive card system that could accomodate graphs, tables, calendars, and more.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fin-tip&quot;&gt;	
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
	Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORMS has become a robust internal tool for a national workforce. With a small team and close collaboration with our client, we were able to deliver a fully-responsive CRM that suits the Outlook Group’s specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five of My Favorite Sketch Plugins</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;You know what’s awesome about Sketch? Quite a lot of things. One of my favorites? Plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I switched over from Photoshop to Sketch as my primary web design tool, I had used Photoshop plugins. However, I often found myself frustrated with how to find, download, install, and configure them. With Sketch, it’s a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sketch-toolbox&quot;&gt;Sketch Toolbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/sketch-toolbox.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch Toolbox Screenshot&quot; /&gt;
Before we dive into my favorite plugins, if you use Sketch and you haven’t installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://sketchtoolbox.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Sketch Toolbox&lt;/a&gt; yet, prepare to be excited. Sketch Toolbox is an application created by members of the Sketch community that lets you easily manage your plugins. Definitely check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, some of my favorite plugins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomutomsketch-measure-targetblank-classlink--headingsketch-measurea&quot;&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Sketch Measure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/sketch-measure-example.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch Measure Animated Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sketch Measure is an invaluable tool for annotating your design comps. The plugin helps you create markings to show heights, widths, paddings, and margins of elements. It’s great for sharing designs with developers or fellow designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomandrewfiorillosketch-palettes-targetblank-classlink--headingsketch-palettesa&quot;&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Sketch Palettes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/sketch-palettes-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch Measure Animated Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve used Photoshop, then you’re familiar with how you can save out and load sets of color swatches. This kind of color management is especially useful if you’re working on a project with a lot of other designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Sketch doesn’t come with the same functionality. Each new file requires you to re-add colors one-by-one. Setting up colors in file after file can get old pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the Sketch Palettes plugin lets you export and later load sets of colors into your new Sketch files. Save, load, and presto! Quick color palettes in Sketch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever created a button with the perfect size but then had to change the text and readjust its padding? Fret no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Buttons allows you to specify the padding of your button and then, whenever you change the text within, you can use a simple keyboard shortcut dynamically readjust its padding. Pixel perfect button padding made simple. Oh, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@poohbers/dynamic-button-sketch-plugin-946638e73398#.t29zevs6g&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here’s a quick how-to!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://isl.co&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt;, we constantly use Slack to message each other about anything and everything. Slack has also become a fast way to share and discuss designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Send to Slack plugin, you can quickly send an art board in Sketch to anyone on your Slack team. Instead of having to export and upload art boards, the plugin lets you select a user or channel to export and upload to all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/11/conference-recap-fowd-sf.html#web-accessibility-is-more-than-accessible-code&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Jennison Asuncion’s talk&lt;/a&gt;  at the FOWD conference, accessible design has been on my mind. The Color Contrast Analyzer plugin lets you find out if the colors in your design have a high enough contrast for users with low vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugin adheres to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;W3’s accessibility guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and instantly shows you what rating your work would receive (A, AA, AAA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-theres-more&quot;&gt;And there’s more…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of Sketch plugins is growing every day thanks to a thriving Sketch community. Do you have any favorite plugins? Let me know below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid--featured-image&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/featured-image-fosi.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fosi.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Family Online Safety Institute&lt;/a&gt; (FOSI) came to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; to redesign and rebuild their website. Our mission was twofold —to combine fosi.org and aplaftormforgood.org (now Good Digital Parenting) under one umbrella, and to create a beautiful design and a user friendly experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The redesign process involved diving deep into Google Analytics, conducting user testing with key audiences, and unifying the two sites through detailed wireframing and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working closely with our client, we successfully created a digital hub for online safety news, research, and events. With a focus on information architecture and design, the project aimed to reorganize content and present it in a digestible, mobile-friendly format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-the-audience&quot;&gt;Understanding the Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fosi.org was a challenge due to its wide range of intended audiences. In addition to online safety information for families, the site needed to cater to a variety of individuals from professionals seeking out industry conferences and events to  policy makers that utilize FOSI’s many research articles in everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;personas&quot;&gt;Personas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to better understand each type of user, we created a variety personas to serve as references throughout the design process. By working closely with the FOSI team, we were able to ensure that the personas accurately reflected their intended audiences. We could then use these personas as a reference for any debates or decisions throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/persona-david.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	    
	&lt;/div&gt; 
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half end&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/persona-mary.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-flows&quot;&gt;User Flows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fictional personas allowed us to create user flows that aided in the identification of discrete goals and actions for each type of user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
    	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-user-flow-david.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;site-structure&quot;&gt;Site Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analyzing user flows and also interviewing stakeholders, we reorganized content into three main buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Family Resources (Good digital Parenting)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Policy and Research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrating of FOSI’s pre-existing content into three main buckets simplified the process of finding content for the end user. Not only that, but the structure allowed us to make content a priority something something here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[sitemap here]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototyping&quot;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the functionality we wanted to include in the site, such as a sticky navigation and fixed filters, are often difficult to describe to clients using static wireframes. To better communicate the small details that would improve the new FOSI experience, our team created a set of animated wireframes in addition to our standard wireframe set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/155266319?autoplay=1&amp;amp;loop=1&amp;amp;loop=1&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-wireframes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;visual-design&quot;&gt;Visual Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;typography&quot;&gt;Typography&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be inviting to parents, yet authoritative and reliable to professionals, I chose typefaces that mixed organic sans-serif headings with more traditional serifed text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-type-example.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aaux-next&quot;&gt;Aaux Next&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaux Next is an approachabe sans-serif that was chosen for headings due to its mix of solid structure and rounded, more quirky, characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minion-pro&quot;&gt;Minion Pro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minion Pro exhibits functional qualities that makes text highly readable. I chose it to give formality and legibility to the site’s main content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;colors&quot;&gt;Colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With content being broken up into several main sections, I defined colors that would be related to each type of content (green for Good Digital Parenting, red for Policy &amp;amp; Research, etc). By tying specific colors to content, we were able to visually separate internal platforms each internal platform and give the user clear context to their location on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-colors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fin-tip&quot;&gt;	
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
	A Flexible, Responsive Publishing Platform
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, the new FOSI.org is a multi-faceted publishing platform. From online-safety print outs to the latest research on internet privacy, FOSI works to publish educational content that helps families (and the industry at large) learn and grow in the new digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating flexible layouts, a new design system, and an integration with Wagtail, a Django-based CMS, we were able to provide FOSI with a rethought and redesigned responsive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Service Year</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid--featured-image grid--no-bg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img class=&quot;item-img--full&quot; src=&quot;/assets/work/serviceyear/featured-image-sy.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-overview&quot;&gt;Project Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Service Year Alliance teamed up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; to design and develop a digital platform for young Americans to connect and serve with the nation’s best nonprofits. Service Year aims to make a year of service a common expectation and opportunity for every young American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ongoing and ever-evolving project, the site brings the nation’s best service opportunities into one place, allowing both organizations and service corps members to more easily connect with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing (July 2016), the Service Year platform has registered over 500 service members, 260 organizations, and over 800 service opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stats (verify these with Chad):
– 260 Orgs
– 520 Corps Members
– 560 Listings
– 120 serving corps members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-role&quot;&gt;My Role&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the project, I worked with several other designers and touched many aspects of the platform. From conducting initial user research to iterating on variouinformation architecture and user flows and also worked closely with our team’s UX lead on various user flows, wireframes, user testing, and design refinement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-experience&quot;&gt;User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest of this project is the management of various user and content types and determining how they interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform needs to cater to a variety of different user types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization Administrators&lt;/strong&gt; that manage an organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization Users&lt;/strong&gt; that post and recruit for individual service opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals&lt;/strong&gt; searching for and serving in service opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing the nation’s largest collection 
Service Year is the nation’s largest single collection of year long service opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about how big the platform really is
– Made up of Corps Members (users looking for service opportunities), Organization Users (that create positions, listings for opportunities, and search for CMs), and Admins (the team that manages the orgs and user in the system).
– All three of these user types interact with their own unique dashboard and mapping the flows of different interactions, models, and objects can prove a difficult challenge, especially with the need to certify various things that orgs post (positions and whatnot)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid-mt grid-mb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/serviceyear/sy-site-map-august-2015.png&quot; alt=&quot;Service Year Sitemap (August 2015)&quot; /&gt;
	    &lt;span class=&quot;img-caption&quot;&gt;Initial sitemaps can give an idea of the number of screens/interactions needed for a project of this scale.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-the-service-year-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Creating the Service Year Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about shaping their process, from signing up to profile creation to finding and being matched with an organization and then documenting their service journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Here, highlight the CM profile that changes over time as a CM progresses through their year(s) of service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations
Talk about positions and listings and the challenge of creating a job posting site that kind of works like a job listing site but not really&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Search
Talk about solving complexity around searching for the different types of content on the SY platform to allow various user types to find what they need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototyping-and-testing&quot;&gt;Prototyping and Testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about using &lt;a href=&quot;http://invisionapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Invision&lt;/a&gt; for prototyping user flows of various interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interface-design&quot;&gt;Interface Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Summary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-living-styleguide&quot;&gt;A Living Styleguide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about challenges with designing for a large-scale web application. Style guides have long been a staple of print and web design. Today, web style guides and design systems are a trending topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While web style guides and frameworks have been around for several years, the explosion of large-scale web applications has brought about an extra focus on creating design systems. Style guides like Salesforce’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Lightning Design System&lt;/a&gt; or Dropbox’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://dropbox.github.io/scooter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Scooter&lt;/a&gt; have set a standard for the design community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Style guides and design systems are the product of convergence of design and development. They provide designers a source of truth for components and guidelines to work from and also allow developers to build faster and more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iteration&quot;&gt;Iteration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-in-agile&quot;&gt;Working in Agile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talk about our Agile process. It’s evolved over time as both the design and development team have discovered things that work and don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talk about going from a single unified sprint to split sprints, back to a unified sprint&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agile&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large system planning is more difficult than meets the eye&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working both with a small (design) team and large (whole) team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning how to fail, recognize the failure, and make changes to improve moving forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
SY is an ongoing and ever evolving project that aims to become the nation’s leader in national service opportunities&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over seventy-five years ago, Prohibition was repealed in the United States and once again beer was sold openly to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s hard to believe is that after all of that time, while almost every other state in our nation embraces consumer convenience, Pennsylvania is still no closer to reforming Prohibition-era beer laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this means you still can’t buy a six-pack of beer conveniently in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemybeer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Free My Beer&lt;/a&gt; is an advocacy group that supports any proposed legislation that would allow convenience and grocery stores to sell beer in the same fashion as restaurants and taverns and they came to us to design and develop their platform’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-for-the-keystone-state&quot;&gt;Designing for the Keystone State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I served as the principal visual designer for the project. After evaluating project goals with our client, I was able to assess that from in terms of a visual language, the site needed to reference the past while looking to the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a mix of historical photography, Pennsylvania-themed symbolism (it’s the Keystone State, after all!), and bold typography that referenced Prohibition-era newspapers, to connect the past with the future and the state of Pennsylvania with this ever-important issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;work-content__container&quot;&gt;

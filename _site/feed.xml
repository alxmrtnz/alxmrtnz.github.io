http://continuousdelivery.com/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, I’ve been working closely with a team of designers, developers, and project managers at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.serviceyr.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Service Year&lt;/a&gt;, a platform that connects individuals with national service opportunities across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From day one, our team set out to design, build, and iterate withing an agile framework. But what exactly did that mean and, after two years, what does it mean now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-past-terminology&quot;&gt;Get Past Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which industry you may fall into, it makes sense that teams want to work as efficiently as possible to put out the best product they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With articles talking about anything from agile methodology to lean processes to continuous delivery and all of the rises and falls of each, it’s easy to get bogged down by terminology instead of focusing on the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’ve learned anything from our work on Service Year, it’s that design and development processes evolve to suit both the team working on a project and its stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we design, build, test, ship, and iterate on a digital product?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many articles out there proclaiming that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;agile is dead&lt;/a&gt;,” “continuous delivery” is where we’re heading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stick-to-principles&quot;&gt;Stick to Principles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it sounds like an ambitious project, it’s because it is. Our team partnered with the Service Year Alliance, to create a source of truth for anyone looking to serve with a nonprofit or other organization in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;never-settle&quot;&gt;Never Settle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When getting started creating anything for the web, it’s easy to think of a project in terms of a linear process. A team is given a problem to solve, the designer creates a solution to that problem, and a developer implements that solution. Your team celebrates the solution’s launch and everyone is happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as we all know, that’s simply not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;never-settle-1&quot;&gt;Never Settle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A designer and hands off to a developer you’ve likely heard of a variety of design processes with some funky names. From waterfall to lean to agile to what may now be a move toward “Continuous Delivery,” being a product designer means figuring out what works best for your team and your project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From building a car to producing a website, the waterfall method has long been one of the most popular processes for production industries. Comprised of a discrete series of steps completed in succession, one could say that waterfall is the production line of processes of all work processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, the waterfall method is efficient. There is a clear start and finish to each phase of a project and everyone is on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the realm of digital products, where MVPs (minimum vialable products), user testing, and iteration are used to gauge the success of new features and produce a road map for the product itself, the waterfall method has its flaws. A lack of collaboration and communication between teams members due to a segmented waterfall process can lead to miscommunication, a less successful project, and overall sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-agile&quot;&gt;Enter Agile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A newer methodology, the agile process, aims to fix some of the problems caused by is a process created by software engineers in the early 2000’s that helps teams design, build, and iterate faster than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Designing with Agile</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past two years, I’ve been working closely with a team of designers, developers, and project managers at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.serviceyr.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Service Year&lt;/a&gt;, a platform that connects individuals with national service opportunities across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From day one, our team set out to design, build, and iterate withing an agile framework. But what exactly did that mean and, after two years, what does it mean now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defining-the-process&quot;&gt;Defining the Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile is a methodology created by software engineers in the early 2000’s to help teams design, build, and iterate faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The values that make up the process for web projects includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working software over comprehensive documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer collaboration over contract negotiation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Responding to change over following a plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, using the agile process means that a team (and its client) defines problems to solve, designs and builds solutions to those problems, tests those solutions with real users, and refines those solutions over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read up about agile &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howdesign.com/editors-picks/dont-go-chasing-waterfalls-agile-web-design/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but in terms of our process on Service Year&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five of My Favorite Sketch Plugins</title>
        <description>
&lt;p&gt;You know what’s awesome about Sketch? Quite a lot of things. One of my favorites? Plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I switched over from Photoshop to Sketch as my primary web design tool, I had used Photoshop plugins. However, I often found myself frustrated with how to find, download, install, and configure them. With Sketch, it’s a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sketch-toolbox&quot;&gt;Sketch Toolbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/sketch-toolbox.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch Toolbox Screenshot&quot; /&gt;
Before we dive into my favorite plugins, if you use Sketch and you haven’t installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://sketchtoolbox.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Sketch Toolbox&lt;/a&gt; yet, prepare to be excited. Sketch Toolbox is an application created by members of the Sketch community that lets you easily manage your plugins. Definitely check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, some of my favorite plugins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomutomsketch-measure-targetblank-classlink--headingsketch-measurea&quot;&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Sketch Measure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/sketch-measure-example.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch Measure Animated Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sketch Measure is an invaluable tool for annotating your design comps. The plugin helps you create markings to show heights, widths, paddings, and margins of elements. It’s great for sharing designs with developers or fellow designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomandrewfiorillosketch-palettes-targetblank-classlink--headingsketch-palettesa&quot;&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Sketch Palettes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/sketch-palettes-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch Measure Animated Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve used Photoshop, then you’re familiar with how you can save out and load sets of color swatches. This kind of color management is especially useful if you’re working on a project with a lot of other designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Sketch doesn’t come with the same functionality. Each new file requires you to re-add colors one-by-one. Setting up colors in file after file can get old pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the Sketch Palettes plugin lets you export and later load sets of colors into your new Sketch files. Save, load, and presto! Quick color palettes in Sketch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomddwhtsketch-dynamic-button-targetblank-classlink--headingdynamic-buttonsa&quot;&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ddwht/sketch-dynamic-button&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Dynamic Buttons&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ddwht/sketch-dynamic-button&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/dynamic-buttons-screenshot.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Dynamic Buttons Animated Screenshot&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever created a button with the perfect size but then had to change the text and readjust its padding? Fret no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Buttons allows you to specify the padding of your button and then, whenever you change the text within, you can use a simple keyboard shortcut dynamically readjust its padding. Pixel perfect button padding made simple. Oh, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@poohbers/dynamic-button-sketch-plugin-946638e73398#.t29zevs6g&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here’s a quick how-to!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomshahruzsend-to-slack-targetblank-classlink--headingsend-to-slacka&quot;&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shahruz/Send-to-Slack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Send to Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://isl.co&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt;, we constantly use Slack to message each other about anything and everything. Slack has also become a fast way to share and discuss designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Send to Slack plugin, you can quickly send an art board in Sketch to anyone on your Slack team. Instead of having to export and upload art boards, the plugin lets you select a user or channel to export and upload to all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomgetflourishsketch-color-contrast-analyser-targetblank-classlink--headingcolor-contrast-analyser-for-sketcha&quot;&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getflourish/Sketch-Color-Contrast-Analyser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Color Contrast Analyser for Sketch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/11/conference-recap-fowd-sf.html#web-accessibility-is-more-than-accessible-code&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Jennison Asuncion’s talk&lt;/a&gt;  at the FOWD conference, accessible design has been on my mind. The Color Contrast Analyzer plugin lets you find out if the colors in your design have a high enough contrast for users with low vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugin adheres to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;W3’s accessibility guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and instantly shows you what rating your work would receive (A, AA, AAA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-theres-more&quot;&gt;And there’s more…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of Sketch plugins is growing every day thanks to a thriving Sketch community. Do you have any favorite plugins? Let me know below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Washington Leadership Academy</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid--featured-image grid--no-bg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full &quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img class=&quot;item-img--full&quot; src=&quot;/assets/work/wla/featured-image-wla.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-overview&quot;&gt;Project Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington Leadership Academy is a public charter school working to change the way we think about high school education. With a mission to provide sutdents in the District of Columbia with the knowledge, skills and habits required for success in college and lives of public leadership, WLA came to our team at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; for a branding and website overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project presented our team with a unique opportunity to create a site from the ground up on Squarespace, design and build a client project in the open, give back to our local community, and help lead the way for a new kind high school education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-a-modular-design-system&quot;&gt;Creating a Modular Design System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create custom Squarespace site that would be easily customizeable and maintainable in the future, our team set out to craft a set of reusable and modular components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing and building in components would enabled us to think of the site block by block instead of page by page and in turn, creating greater future flexibility for the WLA team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wireframing-and-prototyping&quot;&gt;Wireframing and Prototyping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initially set out to create a set of 4-5 template pages, each with their own purpose/use. However, it quickly became clear that creating a set of moveable modules would allow for greater custimization down the line.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We held several internal wireframing workshops. Including one where we identified the most important reusable blocks, cut them out, and documented them using Github issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allowed us to account for a variety of modules and convey to the client how they would fit together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next, we put together an Invision prototype of the wireframes to show the client how the different components could come together in a page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/wla/wla-wireframe-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wireframe of WLA&#39;s Home Page&quot; /&gt;
	    
	&lt;/div&gt; 
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half end&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/wla/wla-wireframe-about.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wireframe of WLA&#39;s About Page&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/wla/team-wireframe-workshop1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ISL team wireframing workshop&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sketch, Photoshop, Omnigraffle, Illustrator, Balsamiq… the list goes on and on. It’s a bit too easy to jump straight into your favorite design tool and start cranking out wireframes for a project without assessing the real needs of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excercise we found most useful was printing out and then cutting apart wireframes to determine which components to keep and which to toss. Then, in order to keep track of each component, both for future visual design and development, we photographed each and saved it as an issue on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;visual-design&quot;&gt;Visual Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team was presented with a set of exciting challenges. It’s not often that a client With the WLA website, our team had the opportunity to explore three things that aren’t often explored on client projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create for good (pro bono work)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a custom site using Squarespace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design and build in the open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing--developing-in-the-open&quot;&gt;Designing (&amp;amp; Developing) in the Open&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-tools-we-used&quot;&gt;The Tools We Used&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Github&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-overview&quot;&gt;Project Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Service Year Alliance teamed up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://sketchtoolbox.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; to design and develop a digital platform for young Americans to connect and serve with the nation’s best nonprofits. Service Year aims to make a year of service a common expectation and opportunity for every young American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ongoing and ever-evolving project, the site brings the nation’s best service opportunities into one place, allowing both organizations and service members to more easily connect with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stats (get these from Chad):
– # Orgs
– # Users
– # SYs begun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-role&quot;&gt;My Role&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Service Year project, I served as the lead visual designer and also worked closely with our team’s UX lead on various user flows, wireframes, user testing, and design refinement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I designed various public facing pages, user flows, and established a style guide that serves as a source of truth for the project’s many design tasks –- documenting everything from buttons to forms to type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-service-year-universe&quot;&gt;The Service Year Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest of this project is the management of various user and content types and determining how they interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform needed to cater to three various user types:
- Organization administrators that manage the org entity
- Organization users that manage recruitment for individual listings
- Individuals searching and serving in service opportunities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing the nation’s largest collection 
Service Year is the nation’s largest single collection of year long service opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talk about how big the platform really is
– Made up of Corps Members (users looking for service opportunities), Organization Users (that create positions, listings for opportunities, and search for CMs), and Admins (the team that manages the orgs and user in the system).
– All three of these user types interact with their own unique dashboard and mapping the flows of different interactions, models, and objects can prove a difficult challenge, especially with the need to certify various things that orgs post (positions and whatnot)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corps Members
Talk about shaping their process, from signing up to profile creation to finding and being matched with an organization and then documenting their service journey. 
– Here, highlight the CM profile that changes over time as a CM progresses through their year(s) of service&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizations
Talk about positions and listings and the challenge of creating a job posting site that kind of works like a job listing site but not really&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Search
Talk about solving complexity around searching for the different types of content on the SY platform to allow various user types to find what they need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-centered-design&quot;&gt;User Centered Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##headline two&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototyping-and-testing&quot;&gt;Prototyping and Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;agile-iteration&quot;&gt;Agile Iteration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about our Agile process. It’s evolved over time as both the design and development team have discovered things that work and don’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about going from a single unified sprint to split sprints, back to a unified sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agile&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large system planning is more difficult than meets the eye&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working both with a small (design) team and large (whole) team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning how to fail, recognize the failure, and make changes to improve moving forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion
SY is an ongoing and ever evolving project that aims to become the nation’s leader in national service opportunities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fosi.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Family Online Safety Institute&lt;/a&gt; (FOSI) came to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; to redesign and rebuild their website. Our mission was twofold —to combine fosi.org and aplaftormforgood.org (now Good Digital Parenting) under one umbrella, and to create a beautiful design and a user friendly experience&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The redesign process involved diving deep into Google Analytics, conducting user testing with key audiences, and unifying the two sites through detailed wireframing and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working closely with our client, we successfully created a digital hub for online safety news, research, and events. With a focus on information architecture and design, the project aimed to reorganize content and present it in a digestible, mobile-friendly format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-the-audience&quot;&gt;Understanding the Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fosi.org was a challenge due to its wide range of intended audiences. In addition to online safety information for families, the site needed to cater to a variety of individuals from professionals seeking out industry conferences and events to  policy makers that utilize FOSI’s many research articles in everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;personas&quot;&gt;Personas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to better understand each type of user, we created a variety personas to serve as references throughout the design process. By working closely with the FOSI team, we were able to ensure that the personas accurately reflected their intended audiences. We could then use these personas as a reference for any debates or decisions throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/persona-david.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	    
	&lt;/div&gt; 
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half end&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/persona-mary.jpg&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-flows&quot;&gt;User Flows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fictional personas allowed us to create user flows that aided in the identification of discrete goals and actions for each type of user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
    	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-user-flow-david.png&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;site-structure&quot;&gt;Site Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analyzing user flows and also interviewing stakeholders, we reorganized content into three main buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Family Resources (Good digital Parenting)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Policy and Research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrating of FOSI’s pre-existing content into three main buckets simplified the process of finding content for the end user. Not only that, but the structure allowed us to make content a priority something something here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[sitemap here]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototyping&quot;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the functionality we wanted to include in the site, such as a sticky navigation and fixed filters, are often difficult to describe to clients using static wireframes. To better communicate the small details that would improve the new FOSI experience, our team created a set of animated wireframes in addition to our standard wireframe set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/155266319?autoplay=1&amp;amp;loop=1&amp;amp;loop=1&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-wireframes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;visual-design&quot;&gt;Visual Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;typography&quot;&gt;Typography&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be inviting to parents, yet authoritative and reliable to professionals, I chose typefaces that mixed organic sans-serif headings with more traditional serifed text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-type-example.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aaux-next&quot;&gt;Aaux Next&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaux Next is an approachabe sans-serif that was chosen for headings due to its mix of solid structure and rounded, more quirky, characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minion-pro&quot;&gt;Minion Pro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minion Pro exhibits functional qualities that makes text highly readable. I chose it to give formality and legibility to the site’s main content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;colors&quot;&gt;Colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With content being broken up into several main sections, I defined colors that would be related to each type of content (green for Good Digital Parenting, red for Policy &amp;amp; Research, etc). By tying specific colors to content, we were able to visually separate internal platforms each internal platform and give the user clear context to their location on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-colors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fin-tip&quot;&gt;	
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
	A Flexible, Responsive Publishing Platform
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, the new FOSI.org is a multi-faceted publishing platform. From online-safety print outs to the latest research on internet privacy, FOSI works to publish educational content that helps families (and the industry at large) learn and grow in the new digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating flexible layouts, a new design system, and an integration with Wagtail, a Django-based CMS, we were able to provide FOSI with a rethought and redesigned responsive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over seventy-five years ago, Prohibition was repealed in the United States and once again beer was sold openly to the public. What’s hard to believe is that after all of that time, while almost every other state in our nation embraces consumer convenience, Pennsylvania is still no closer to reforming Prohibition-era beer laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this means you still can’t buy a six-pack of beer conveniently in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemybeer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Free My Beer&lt;/a&gt; is an advocacy group that supports any proposed legislation that would allow convenience and grocery stores to sell beer in the same fashion as restaurants and taverns and they came to us to design and develop their platform’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-for-the-keystone-state&quot;&gt;Designing for the Keystone State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I served as the principal visual designer for the project. After evaluating project goals with our client, I was able to assess that from in terms of a visual language, the site needed to reference the past while looking to the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a mix of historical photography, Pennsylvania-themed symbolism (it’s the Keystone State, after all!), and bold typography that referenced Prohibition-era newspapers, to connect the past with the future and the state of Pennsylvania with this ever-important issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid grid--featured-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fosi.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Family Online Safety Institute&lt;/a&gt; (FOSI) came to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isl.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt; to redesign and rebuild their website.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-the-audience&quot;&gt;Understanding the Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fosi.org was a challenge due to its wide range of intended audiences. In addition to online safety information for families, the site needed to cater to a variety of individuals from professionals seeking out industry conferences and events to  policy makers that utilize FOSI’s many research articles in everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;personas&quot;&gt;Personas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to better understand each type of user, we created a variety personas to serve as references throughout the design process. By working closely with the FOSI team, we were able to ensure that the personas accurately reflected their intended audiences. We could then use these personas as a reference for any debates or decisions throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;grid&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--half&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-flows&quot;&gt;User Flows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fictional personas allowed us to create user flows that aided in the identification of discrete goals and actions for each type of user.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;site-structure&quot;&gt;Site Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analyzing user flows and also interviewing stakeholders, we reorganized content into three main buckets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Family Resources (Good digital Parenting)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Policy and Research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concentrating of FOSI’s pre-existing content into three main buckets simplified the process of finding content for the end user. Not only that, but the structure allowed us to make content a priority something something here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aaux-next&quot;&gt;Aaux Next&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaux Next is an approachabe sans-serif that was chosen for headings due to its mix of solid structure and rounded, more quirky, characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minion-pro&quot;&gt;Minion Pro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minion Pro exhibits functional qualities that makes text highly readable. I chose it to give formality and legibility to the site’s main content.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;grid__item grid__item--full&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/work/fosi/fosi-colors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fin-tip&quot;&gt;	
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
	A Flexible, Responsive Publishing Platform
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, the new FOSI.org is a multi-faceted publishing platform. From online-safety print outs to the latest research on internet privacy, FOSI works to publish educational content that helps families (and the industry at large) learn and grow in the new digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By creating flexible layouts, a new design system, and an integration with Wagtail, a Django-based CMS, we were able to provide FOSI with a rethought and redesigned responsive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what’s awesome about Sketch? Quite a lot of things. One of my favorites? Plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I switched over from Photoshop to Sketch as my primary web design tool, I had used Photoshop plugins. However, I often found myself frustrated with how to find, download, install, and configure them. With Sketch, it’s a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sketch-toolbox&quot;&gt;Sketch Toolbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/sketch-toolbox.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch Toolbox Screenshot&quot; /&gt;
Before we dive into my favorite plugins, if you use Sketch and you haven’t installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://sketchtoolbox.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Sketch Toolbox&lt;/a&gt; yet, prepare to be excited. Sketch Toolbox is an application created by members of the Sketch community that lets you easily manage your plugins. Definitely check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, some of my favorite plugins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomutomsketch-measure-targetblank-classlink--headingsketch-measurea&quot;&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Sketch Measure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/sketch-measure-example.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch Measure Animated Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sketch Measure is an invaluable tool for annotating your design comps. The plugin helps you create markings to show heights, widths, paddings, and margins of elements. It’s great for sharing designs with developers or fellow designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomandrewfiorillosketch-palettes-targetblank-classlink--headingsketch-palettesa&quot;&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Sketch Palettes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/sketch-palettes-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch Measure Animated Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve used Photoshop, then you’re familiar with how you can save out and load sets of color swatches. This kind of color management is especially useful if you’re working on a project with a lot of other designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Sketch doesn’t come with the same functionality. Each new file requires you to re-add colors one-by-one. Setting up colors in file after file can get old pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the Sketch Palettes plugin lets you export and later load sets of colors into your new Sketch files. Save, load, and presto! Quick color palettes in Sketch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomddwhtsketch-dynamic-button-targetblank-classlink--headingdynamic-buttonsa&quot;&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ddwht/sketch-dynamic-button&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Dynamic Buttons&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ddwht/sketch-dynamic-button&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/dynamic-buttons-screenshot.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Dynamic Buttons Animated Screenshot&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever created a button with the perfect size but then had to change the text and readjust its padding? Fret no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Buttons allows you to specify the padding of your button and then, whenever you change the text within, you can use a simple keyboard shortcut dynamically readjust its padding. Pixel perfect button padding made simple. Oh, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@poohbers/dynamic-button-sketch-plugin-946638e73398#.t29zevs6g&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here’s a quick how-to!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomshahruzsend-to-slack-targetblank-classlink--headingsend-to-slacka&quot;&gt;4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shahruz/Send-to-Slack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Send to Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shahruz/Send-to-Slack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/11-28-15/send-to-slack-example.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Send to Slack Animated Screenshot&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://isl.co&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISL&lt;/a&gt;, we constantly use Slack to message each other about anything and everything. Slack has also become a fast way to share and discuss designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Send to Slack plugin, you can quickly send an art board in Sketch to anyone on your Slack team. Instead of having to export and upload art boards, the plugin lets you select a user or channel to export and upload to all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-hrefhttpsgithubcomgetflourishsketch-color-contrast-analyser-targetblank-classlink--headingcolor-contrast-analyser-for-sketcha&quot;&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getflourish/Sketch-Color-Contrast-Analyser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--heading&quot;&gt;Color Contrast Analyser for Sketch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/11/conference-recap-fowd-sf.html#web-accessibility-is-more-than-accessible-code&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Jennison Asuncion’s talk&lt;/a&gt;  at the FOWD conference, accessible design has been on my mind. The Color Contrast Analyzer plugin lets you find out if the colors in your design have a high enough contrast for users with low vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plugin adheres to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;W3’s accessibility guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and instantly shows you what rating your work would receive (A, AA, AAA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-theres-more&quot;&gt;And there’s more…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of Sketch plugins is growing every day thanks to a thriving Sketch community. Do you have any favorite plugins? Let me know below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Finding a Work Life Balance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You know what’s awesome about Sketch? Quite a lot of things. One of my favorites? Plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I switched over from Photoshop to Sketch as my primary web design tool, I had used Photoshop plugins. However, I often found myself frustrated with how to find, download, install, and generally configure them to get them to do what I wanted. With Sketch, it’s a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-first-sketch-toolbox&quot;&gt;But First… Sketch Toolbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into my favorite plugins, if you use Sketch and you haven’t installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://sketchtoolbox.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Sketch Toolbox&lt;/a&gt; yet, prepare to get excited. Sketch Toolbox is an amazing application created by members of the Sketch community that lets you easily manage your Sketch plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does three HUGE things for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lets you browse the most popular plugins available for Sketch
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sketch Toolbox connects directly to GitHub repositories of the latest plugins generated by members of the Sketch community&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Downloads and installs new plugins with a single click
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;No more downloading and moving plugin files around within your app directories. One-click-install and you’re done&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatically keeps all your plugins up to date
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Being connected to a plugin’s GitHub repo means that Sketch Toolbox can simply download the latest sourcecode and keep you up to date&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve got Sketch Toolbox installed, you’ll be rolling with plugins in no time. And now, some of my favorite plugins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sketch-measure&quot;&gt;1) Sketch Measure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynamic-buttons&quot;&gt;2) Dynamic Buttons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s designing a logo for the project, contributing source code, or just adding to the conversation, find the thing you’re most passionate about and contribute. There are also some &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendesign.foundation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opensourcedesign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; you can go to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;side-projects-are-stupid-and-theyre-supposed-to-be&quot;&gt;Side Projects are Stupid… and They’re Supposed to Be&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been looking forward to being introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/schneidertobias&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Tobias van Schneider&lt;/a&gt; (and his luscious beard) for some time. Tobias is a German-born designer that recently led the Spotify brand refresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His talk focused on how keeping side projects focused around fun and stupid ideas helps us from freezing up and over thinking about our work. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://authenticweather.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Authentic Weather&lt;/a&gt; to his own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beardbrand.com/products/black-marble-beard-oil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;line of beard oil&lt;/a&gt;, Tobias has always thought small instead and followed through on some downright silly ideas that have turned into (sometimes viral) side projects. Some guiding principles for successful side projects? Let yourself be stupid, ignore everybody (they all have their own ideas and opinions of how things should be), trust your gut, and stay busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;web-accessibility-is-more-than-accessible-code&quot;&gt;Web Accessibility is More than Accessible Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As practitioners of web design and development, it’s our job to make our websites usable, visually pleasing, and accessible – and that doesn’t mean just developers/engineers implementing accessible code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jennison&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;Jennison Asuncion&lt;/a&gt;, Co-Director of the Adaptech Research Network, spoke about how producing accessible content means designing and developing user experiences that everyone, including people with disabilities, can independently consume and interact with. From touching on resources for &lt;a href=&quot;http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;sufficient color contrast&lt;/a&gt; to walking us through the experience of using a screenreader on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/?root=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;link--text-in-p&quot;&gt;United.com&lt;/a&gt;, Jennison got me thinking about how web professionals can (and should) improve accessibility across their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a first web conference experience, it was a blast and extremely inspiring. If you’re a web professional or have just been thinking about putting yourself out there and learning how we creatives can help impact the world around us, I’d recommend attending a conference like FOWD. I’m already planning my next steps of finding and contributing to an open source project, working to make my sites more accessible, and might even be thinking about my own beard oil… well, we’ll see about that last one. Now get out there and get learning!&lt;/p&gt;

http://continuousdelivery.com/</p>

<p>For the past two years, I’ve been working closely with a team of designers, developers, and project managers at <a href="https://www.isl.co/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">ISL</a> on <a href="https://www.serviceyr.org/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Service Year</a>, a platform that connects individuals with national service opportunities across the United States.</p>

<p>From day one, our team set out to design, build, and iterate withing an agile framework. But what exactly did that mean and, after two years, what does it mean now?</p>

<h2 id="get-past-terminology">Get Past Terminology</h2>

<p>Regardless of which industry you may fall into, it makes sense that teams want to work as efficiently as possible to put out the best product they can.</p>

<p>With articles talking about anything from agile methodology to lean processes to continuous delivery and all of the rises and falls of each, it’s easy to get bogged down by terminology instead of focusing on the process.</p>

<p>If I’ve learned anything from our work on Service Year, it’s that design and development processes evolve to suit both the team working on a project and its stakeholders.</p>

<p>How do we design, build, test, ship, and iterate on a digital product?</p>

<p>There are many articles out there proclaiming that “<a href="https://www.isl.co/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">agile is dead</a>,” “continuous delivery” is where we’re heading.</p>

<h2 id="stick-to-principles">Stick to Principles</h2>

<p>If it sounds like an ambitious project, it’s because it is. Our team partnered with the Service Year Alliance, to create a source of truth for anyone looking to serve with a nonprofit or other organization in the US.</p>

<h2 id="never-settle">Never Settle</h2>

<p>When getting started creating anything for the web, it’s easy to think of a project in terms of a linear process. A team is given a problem to solve, the designer creates a solution to that problem, and a developer implements that solution. Your team celebrates the solution’s launch and everyone is happy.</p>

<p>But as we all know, that’s simply not true.</p>

<h2 id="never-settle-1">Never Settle</h2>

<p>A designer and hands off to a developer you’ve likely heard of a variety of design processes with some funky names. From waterfall to lean to agile to what may now be a move toward “Continuous Delivery,” being a product designer means figuring out what works best for your team and your project.</p>

<p>From building a car to producing a website, the waterfall method has long been one of the most popular processes for production industries. Comprised of a discrete series of steps completed in succession, one could say that waterfall is the production line of processes of all work processes.</p>

<p>In theory, the waterfall method is efficient. There is a clear start and finish to each phase of a project and everyone is on the same page.</p>

<p>In the realm of digital products, where MVPs (minimum vialable products), user testing, and iteration are used to gauge the success of new features and produce a road map for the product itself, the waterfall method has its flaws. A lack of collaboration and communication between teams members due to a segmented waterfall process can lead to miscommunication, a less successful project, and overall sadness.</p>

<h2 id="enter-agile">Enter Agile</h2>
<p>A newer methodology, the agile process, aims to fix some of the problems caused by is a process created by software engineers in the early 2000’s that helps teams design, build, and iterate faster than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="its-place-on-service-year-2-short-paragraphs">It’s place on Service Year (2 short paragraphs)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>brief overview of Service Year</li>
  <li>history of methods
– always been agile, but being ISL’s first large scale application build, our process has also gone through many iterations and is always evolving
– Sprints broken up by team at first, then alternated, now together</li>
  <li>Determination of Resources, LOE-ing:</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to identify problems and change methods</li>
  <li>Shorter lifecycles for features means being able to refine them over time</li>
  <li>Opportunity to learn, change, and grow, both as individuals and team members</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Quick turnaround time for each sprint can often lead to a lack of documentation (style guide) and sometimes miscommunication</li>
  <li>Many many meetings: In order to plan and execute each two-week sprint, there are many meetings both internally and with our client.</li>
  <li>The need to really complete each feature 100% within each iteration: this can become tiring for both developers and designers. Luckily, building a tight knit relationship with our client allows us to reevaluate and modify processes as needed.</li>
  <li>(Initial) Difficulty onboarding new team members</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Working on a large software and design system can be a challenging and rewarding task.</p>

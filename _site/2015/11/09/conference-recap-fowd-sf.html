<p>A perk of working on a design team at a company like ISL is getting the opportunity to grow both creatively and professionally. Our team has a budget set aside for each designer to attend industry conferences. Recently, I took advantage of the perk and flew myself out to sunny San Francisco to attend the Future of Web Design (FOWD), a 3-day event for designers, front-end developers, and other creatives  working to make the web awesome.</p>

<p>Here are some of my top takeaways:</p>

<h2 id="open-source-design-is-a-pretty-awesome-thing">Open Source Design is a (Pretty Awesome) Thing</h2>
<p>The talk that inspired me the most came from <a href="https://twitter.com/garthdb" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Garth Braithwaite</a>, a product designer and front-end developer on PhoneGap at Adobe.</p>

<p>Garth discussed the benefits of open source design and detailed some of his work on <a href="http://www.nightscout.info/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">NightScout</a>, an app developed by parents of children with Type 1 Diabetes to remotely help monitor blood sugar levels (and save lives). By connecting data from a monitoring device called the Dexcom G4, parents can send live updates to their phones and smartwatches.</p>

<p>His advice for getting into open source?</p>

<p>Whether it’s designing a logo for the project, contributing source code, or just adding to the conversation, find the thing you’re most passionate about and contribute. There are also some <a href="http://opendesign.foundation/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">great</a> <a href="https://github.com/opensourcedesign" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">places</a> you can go to get started.</p>

<h2 id="side-projects-are-stupid-and-theyre-supposed-to-be">Side Projects are Stupid… and They’re Supposed to Be</h2>
<p>I had been looking forward to being introduced to <a href="https://twitter.com/schneidertobias" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Tobias van Schneider</a> (and his luscious beard) for some time. Tobias is a German-born designer that recently led the Spotify brand refresh.</p>

<p>His talk focused on how keeping side projects focused around fun and stupid ideas helps us from freezing up and over thinking about our work. From <a href="http://authenticweather.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Authentic Weather</a> to his own <a href="http://www.beardbrand.com/products/black-marble-beard-oil" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">line of beard oil</a>, Tobias has always thought small instead and followed through on some downright silly ideas that have turned into (sometimes viral) side projects. Some guiding principles for successful side projects? Let yourself be stupid, ignore everybody (they all have their own ideas and opinions of how things should be), trust your gut, and stay busy.</p>

<h2 id="web-accessibility-is-more-than-accessible-code">Web Accessibility is More than Accessible Code</h2>
<p>As practitioners of web design and development, it’s our job to make our websites usable, visually pleasing, and accessible – and that doesn’t mean just developers/engineers implementing accessible code.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jennison" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Jennison Asuncion</a>, Co-Director of the Adaptech Research Network, spoke about how producing accessible content means designing and developing user experiences that everyone, including people with disabilities, can independently consume and interact with. From touching on resources for <a href="http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">sufficient color contrast</a> to walking us through the experience of using a screenreader on <a href="https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/?root=1" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">United.com</a>, Jennison got me thinking about how web professionals can (and should) improve accessibility across their work.</p>

<p>For a first web conference experience, it was a blast and extremely inspiring. If you’re a web professional or have just been thinking about putting yourself out there and learning how we creatives can help impact the world around us, I’d recommend attending a conference like FOWD. I’m already planning my next steps of finding and contributing to an open source project, working to make my sites more accessible, and might even be thinking about my own beard oil… well, we’ll see about that last one. Now get out there and get learning!</p>

<p>You’ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve --watch</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code>_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code>YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Tom&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></div>

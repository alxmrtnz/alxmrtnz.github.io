          </header>
          <p>Through <a href="http://metto.co/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Metto</a> , I helped design and build a web application called Benchmarcs that allows funeral homes to monitor trends in business for both their own individual homes and their competitors.</p>

<p>Traditionally, funeral homes tracked “calls,” or deaths, by skimming through obituaries in local newspapers and obituary websites. Because the calls listed in these sources also indicated which funeral home would be performing the funeral, each home could track how much business each competitor was receiving.</p>

<p>With Benchmarcs, we helped automate this process by using web spiders to crawl online data and assess when and where calls happen. In this way, a home saves time and money while also having a central place important competitive data.</p>

<h3 id="tracking-the-competition">Tracking the Competition</h3>

<p>One of the biggest advantages in moving toward an automated system like Benchmarcs is that it gives funeral homes the ability to track their competition.</p>

<p>Adding competitors allows users to see how many calls a competing home received over the last week, month, year, etc and also see trends in calls over that period of time.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>In order to educate new users about the ability to track competitors and to help populate their accounts with competitor data, we decided to integrate the ability to add competitors into the onboarding process.</p>

<div class="pop-out-image__container">
	<a href="/assets/zapier/images/benchmarcs-onboarding-v3.png" target="_blank" class="">
		<div class="pop-out-image">
			<img class="" src="/assets/zapier/images/benchmarcs-onboarding-v3.png" alt="Benchmarcs Onboarding User Flow" />
		</div>
	</a>
	<span class="img-caption">We created user-flow diagrams to outline functionality in the initial onboarding and setup, including the ability to add competitor funeral homes (Getting Started Step 4)</span>
</div>

<p>Conversations with our product owners and several potential users led us to focus on the addition of competitors on a local, rather than regional or national level. We learned that even when the competition has multiple locations across a state or region, homes tend to focus on the competing branch closest to them.</p>

<p>Our initial iteration of adding competitors approximated the user’s location and prepopulated a zip code and radius filter in order to show an initial set of homes in their area.</p>

<div class="pop-out-image__container">
	<a href="/assets/zapier/images/benchmarcs-add-competitors-v1.png" target="_blank" class="">
		<div class="pop-out-image">
			<img class="" src="/assets/zapier/images/benchmarcs-add-competitors-v1.png" alt="Benchmarcs Add a Competitor Wireframe and design V1" />
		</div>
	</a>
	<span class="img-caption">
		We gathered user feedback on the initial "add a competitor" feature from several pilot program users.
	</span>
</div>

<p>While some aspects of the initial functionality fit the bill, the nuances of the design did not.</p>

<p>We thought that a user would pick a zip, radius, and then filter the list of results, but that didn’t happen. Instead, users chose several homes from the pre-populated list before becoming frustrated when they couldn’t find the home they were looking for.</p>

<p>It was unclear to users that the pre-populated list was offering a smaller list of suggestions rather than a complete list of competitors. In the end, this solution made the tool less useful to users and converted them with less competitors than than they really wanted.</p>

<p>While many of our pilot users got by with a few competitors added, there was definitely room to improve the design of this feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>To improve usability, we made a couple of changes to both the visual design and functionality:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>We did away with ZIP and radius</strong> – user testing had shown that these fields were not being used and that users instead focused on the search input</li>
  <li><strong>We made the search bar more prominent</strong> in order to guide the user to take action</li>
  <li><strong>We added the title “Suggested Competitors” to the preloaded competitors list</strong> to communicate to users that this initial list wasn’t exhausted</li>
  <li><strong>We added functionality to deliver more and more relevant results on each selection.</strong> Now, each time the user picks a competitor, we hit the Benchmarcs API, search for homes near the selected competitor and add them to the list of suggestions. Then, we  resort the list based on how many times a competitor is suggested in relation to the competitors selected by the user.</li>
</ol>

<div class="pop-out-image__container">
	<a href="/assets/zapier/images/benchmarcs-interaction.gif" target="_blank" class="">
		<div class="pop-out-image">

		</div>
	</a>
	<span class="img-caption">
		Version two of the "add a competitor" feature led to an overall increase in competitors added by users when setting up their accounts.
	</span>
</div>

<p>While seemingly small, the updated design makes the tool more useful to user and has increased the number of homes a new user adds during setup.</p>

<p>Users could not only find the homes they were looking for, but the designed learning to enhance suggested competitors provided users with a more useful tool.</p>

<h2 id="the-team">The Team</h2>

<p>I work on Benchmarcs with with a small team at Metto, a small fully remote design and development studio. The core team includes two designers (myself and another product designer) and two developers who split duties on frontend and backend.</p>

<p>I also helped style the front-end side of the application and get my hands dirty when working with our Backbone framework, Marionette.</p>

<p>In addition to the team at Metto, we work closely with the application’s product owners, Tyler and Michael Anderson, the CEO and VP of Marketing and Business Development at <a href="http://www.theoutlookgroup.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">The Outlook Group</a>*, to build the standalone application that they are currently marketing to funeral homes in the midwest and across the country.</p>

<p class="footnote">
  *Outlook Group is one of the nation’s largest marketing firms in the pre-need funeral industry.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thanks to an iterative process and a focus on user-centered design, our team can identify issues like the addition of competitors and continue to work on optimizing various aspects of the application as a whole.</p>

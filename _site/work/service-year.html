<p>Intro
- The problem at hand: There are far many more young americans that want to volunteer and give back to their communities than there are positions available.
- The Service Year platform is trying to solve that problem by bringing the nation’s best service opportunities into one place. Not only that, but by creating a clear unified system for discovering and connecting with host organizations, Service Year provides future “corps members” with an easier path to service opportunities (instead of all of the difficult to manage government sites of yesterday).
- Service Year also gives organizations the ability to find individuals with interests that match their needs, giving both parties a means of connecting with one another
- Stats (get these from Chad):
– # Orgs
– # Users
– # SYs begun</p>

<p>My Role
- Brought onto the Service Year project just as an identity and branding was being established. My role was to serve as the lead visual designer and also contribute to user experience design alongside our team’s UX lead.
- Over the past year, I designed various public facing pages (user profiles, search), user flows (profile creation, editing, etc), and established a style guide that serves as a source of truth for the project’s many design tasks documenting everything from buttons to forms to type to various UI elements</p>

<p>Shaping Complexity
- Talk about how big the platform really is
– Made up of Corps Members (users looking for service opportunities), Organization Users (that create positions, listings for opportunities, and search for CMs), and Admins (the team that manages the orgs and user in the system).
– All three of these user types interact with their own unique dashboard and mapping the flows of different interactions, models, and objects can prove a difficult challenge, especially with the need to certify various things that orgs post (positions and whatnot)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Corps Members
Talk about shaping their process, from signing up to profile creation to finding and being matched with an organization and then documenting their service journey. 
– Here, highlight the CM profile that changes over time as a CM progresses through their year(s) of service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organizations
Talk about positions and listings and the challenge of creating a job posting site that kind of works like a job listing site but not really</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Search
Talk about solving complexity around searching for the different types of content on the SY platform to allow various user types to find what they need.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Working in an Agile process (An Ever Evolving Platform)
- Talk about our Agile process. It’s evolved over time as both the design and development team have discovered things that work and don’t work. 
- Talk about going from a single unified sprint to split sprints, back to a unified sprint</p>

<p>Lessons Learned
- Agile
- Large system planning is more difficult than meets the eye
- Working both with a small (design) team and large (whole) team
- Learning how to fail, recognize the failure, and make changes to improve moving forward</p>

<p>Conclusion
SY is an ongoing and ever evolving project that aims to become the nation’s leader in national service opportunities</p>

<p>###User Flows
These fictional personas allowed us to create user flows that aided in the identification of discrete goals and actions for each type of user.</p>

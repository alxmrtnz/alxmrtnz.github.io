      Originally born and bred in the heart of it all (Ohio), I moved to D.C. after attending Ohio University in May of 2014. I'm driven by the goal of crafting the best digital products possible.

      When I'm not at a computer, I spend my time running, cooking, and traveling. I also love a good burrito, French Bulldogs, and baby pandas.

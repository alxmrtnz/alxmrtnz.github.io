<a href="{{ site.url }}/work/service-year" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Service Year</a> is the nation's largest marketplace for year-long, full-time, paid service opportunities. It allows young Americans to discover full-time, paid, year-long service opportunities with organizations from across the country.

High school students that want to contribute to something meaningful during a gap year before college, college graduates trying to find a higher calling, or any young American between the ages of 18-24 can use the platform to connect with impactful organizations.

The platform's focus on connection between organizations and service corps members depends upon the ability for users to find listings and organizations that are tailored to their interests. 



However, after the first iteration of the discovery flow, we found that building the bridge for users was not happening. Users were having difficulty understanding what a "service year" was and how to find positions and get involved. 



Discovering the right position and getting involved with the right organization required a simpler path.


## The Problem

Finding a listing for a service position should be a simple experience that's tailored to a user's interests. However, after conducting in-person and online usability tests with real users, it was clear that the path to discovery was foggy.

After creating the MVP for the platform (which including the public facing marketing pages and a log in system for corps members and organizations), our team was tasked with building out the ability to search listings, positions, organizations, and users.

### Requirements

Create a flexible system for displaying different content types.

Through usability sessions, we identified three key painpoints:

1. Site navigation created an unclear path
2. The homepage did not clearly explain the process of getting involved
3. Narrowing down search results was difficult

## A Team Effort

As a product being designed and built by my company, <a href="https://isl.co/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">ISL</a>, but owned by a client, <a href="https://isl.co/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">The Service Year Alliance</a>, working on this challenge involved a variety of team members.

###User Flows
These fictional personas allowed us to create user flows that aided in the identification of discrete goals and actions for each type of user.

##Site Structure
After analyzing user flows and also interviewing stakeholders, we reorganized content into three main buckets:

1. Family Resources (Good digital Parenting)
2. Policy and Research
3. Events

Concentrating of FOSI's pre-existing content into three main buckets simplified the process of finding content for the end user. Not only that, but the structure allowed us to make content a priority something something here...

##Prototyping
Some of the functionality we wanted to include in the site, such as a sticky navigation and fixed filters, are often difficult to describe to clients using static wireframes. To better communicate the small details that would improve the new FOSI experience, our team created a set of animated wireframes in addition to our standard wireframe set.

Visual Design
----------------------------------------------

###Typography
In order to be inviting to parents, yet authoritative and reliable to professionals, I chose typefaces that mixed organic sans-serif headings with more traditional serifed text.

		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/work/fosi/fosi-type-example.jpg" alt="">
	</div>
</div>

####Aaux Next
Aaux Next is an approachabe sans-serif that was chosen for headings due to its mix of solid structure and rounded, more quirky, characteristics.

####Minion Pro
Minion Pro exhibits functional qualities that makes text highly readable. I chose it to give formality and legibility to the site's main content.


###Colors
With content being broken up into several main sections, I defined colors that would be related to each type of content (green for Good Digital Parenting, red for Policy & Research, etc). By tying specific colors to content, we were able to visually separate internal platforms each internal platform and give the user clear context to their location on the site.

	A Flexible, Responsive Publishing Platform
</h2>

At its core, the new FOSI.org is a multi-faceted publishing platform. From online-safety print outs to the latest research on internet privacy, FOSI works to publish educational content that helps families (and the industry at large) learn and grow in the new digital age. 
		
By creating flexible layouts, a new design system, and an integration with Wagtail, a Django-based CMS, we were able to provide FOSI with a rethought and redesigned responsive experience.

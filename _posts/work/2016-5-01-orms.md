<a href="http://www.theoutlookgroup.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">The Outlook Group</a> is one of the nation's largest marketing firms in the preneed* funeral industry and has a national team of sales representatives who work with individual funeral homes to maintain and develop their own customer bases.

I worked with the group and a small team to create the Outlook Relationship Management System (ORMS), a web application that improves the workflow of The Outlook Group's sales representatives and client funeral homes. 

I focused on establishing the overall visual language and user experience of the platform and also worked closely with project developers throughout implementation.

<p class="footnote">
  * Preneed services include things such as preneed life insurance policies that cover the cost of predetermined expense of a funeral, cremation, or burial.

## Identifying Product Needs

Because The Outlook Group has a national team of sales representatives who work with individual funeral homes, the group wanted us to develop a tool for their team to help clients maintain and develop their own customer base.

After conversations with The Outlook Group and an analysis of their team structure, we identified the core product features that would not only provide benefit to the end user, but also fit into the workflow of the company as a whole.

 : 

* **Contact Management**
	* To allow for recording potential customers and moving them through the acquisition funnel
* **Filtering and Tagging**
	* To monitor and evaluate customers
* **Calendar Integration**
	* To allow sales representatives to record interactions and meetings with customers
* **System Administration**
	* The creation of a centralized hub for system administrators to manage sales representatives

	Takeaways
</h2>

At its core, the new FOSI.org is a multi-faceted publishing platform. From online-safety print outs to the latest research on internet privacy, FOSI works to publish educational content that helps families (and the industry at large) learn and grow in the new digital age. 
		
By creating flexible layouts, a new design system, and an integration with Wagtail, a Django-based CMS, we were able to provide FOSI with a rethought and redesigned responsive experience.

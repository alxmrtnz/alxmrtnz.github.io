<a href="http://www.theoutlookgroup.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">The Outlook Group</a> is one of the nation's largest marketing firms in the preneed* funeral industry and has a national team of sales representatives who work with individual funeral homes to maintain and develop their own customer bases.

I worked with the group and a small team to create the Outlook Relationship Management System (ORMS), a web application that improves the workflow of The Outlook Group's sales representatives and client funeral homes. 

I focused on establishing the overall visual language and user experience of the platform and also worked closely with project developers throughout implementation.

  * Preneed services include things such as preneed life insurance policies that cover the cost of predetermined expense of a funeral, cremation, or burial.

## Identifying Product Needs

Because The Outlook Group has a national team of sales representatives who work with individual funeral homes, the group wanted us to develop a tool for their team to help clients maintain and develop their own customer base.

After conversations with The Outlook Group and an analysis of their team structure, we identified the core product features that would not only provide benefit to the end user, but also fit into the workflow of the company as a whole.

 : 

* **Contact Management**
	* To allow for recording potential customers and moving them through the acquisition funnel
* **Filtering and Tagging**
	* To monitor and evaluate customers
* **Calendar Integration**
	* To allow sales representatives to record interactions and meetings with customers
* **System Administration**
	* The creation of a centralized hub for system administrators to manage sales representatives

<!-- ## Project Goals

Through interviews with group leadership and employees, we learned that The Outlook Group has a national team of sales representatives who work with individual funeral homes in order to maintain and develop their own customer bases.

We worked to accomplish several goals within this project:

* **Contact Management**
	* To allow for recording potential customers and moving them through the acquisition funnel
* **Filtering and Tagging**
	* To monitor and evaluate customers
* **Calendar Integration**
	* To allow sales representatives to record interactions and meetings with customers
* **System Administration**
	* The creation of a centralized hub for system administrators to manage sales representatives

The CRM we created gives their company a custom experience that is tailored to their internal structure, improving employee workflow and increasing overall productivity.

### Wireframing
We quickly learned that the Outlook Group needed a 

After learning the structure of their organization and business strategy, we then sketched a set of initial wireframes.

## Opportunity Management

To allow Outlook Group sales representatives to record and monitor potential customers, we designed a robust opportunities management page. 

Beginning with simple sketches, we were able to validate functionality with Outlook Group stakeholders before moving into visual design.

	</div>
</div>

Through iteration, we designed and implemented essential functionality for filtering, searching, and sorting opportunities.

	    <span class="img-caption">Several iterations of wireframes and visual design lead to a robust page for managing sales opportunities.</span>

## Task Management and Collaboration

We paid special attention to the various interactions that an employee of Outlook Group could need to take on an individual opportunity.

Creating a timeline for notes allows multiple Outlook Group employees to collaborate around an individual customer.

At its core, the new FOSI.org is a multi-faceted publishing platform. From online-safety print outs to the latest research on internet privacy, FOSI works to publish educational content that helps families (and the industry at large) learn and grow in the new digital age. 
		
By creating flexible layouts, a new design system, and an integration with Wagtail, a Django-based CMS, we were able to provide FOSI with a rethought and redesigned responsive experience.

For the past two years, I've been working closely with a team of designers, developers, and project managers at <a href='https://www.isl.co/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">ISL</a> on <a href='https://www.serviceyr.org/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Service Year</a>, a platform that connects individuals with national service opportunities across the United States.

From day one, our team set out to design, build, and iterate withing an agile framework. But what exactly did that mean and, after two years, what does it mean now?

Defining the Process
--------------
Agile is a methodology created by software engineers in the early 2000's to help teams design, build, and iterate faster.

The values that make up the process for web projects includes:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

At its core, using the agile process means that a team (and its client) defines problems to solve, designs and builds solutions to those problems, tests those solutions with real users, and refines those solutions over time.

You can read up about agile <a href='http://www.howdesign.com/editors-picks/dont-go-chasing-waterfalls-agile-web-design/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">here</a>, but in terms of our process on Service Year

But isn't agile... dying?
--------------

A newer methodology, the agile process, aims to fix some of the problems caused by is a process created by software engineers in the early 2000â€™s that helps teams design, build, and iterate faster than ever before.

It's place on Service Year (2 short paragraphs)
----------------------------------------------
- brief overview of Service Year
- history of methods
-- always been agile, but being ISL's first large scale application build, our process has also gone through many iterations and is always evolving
-- Sprints broken up by team at first, then alternated, now together
- Determination of Resources, LOE-ing:

Advantages
----------------------------------------------
- Ability to identify problems and change methods
- Shorter lifecycles for features means being able to refine them over time
- Opportunity to learn, change, and grow, both as individuals and team members

Disadvantages
----------------------------------------------
- Quick turnaround time for each sprint can often lead to a lack of documentation (style guide) and sometimes miscommunication
- Many many meetings: In order to plan and execute each two-week sprint, there are many meetings both internally and with our client.
- The need to really complete each feature 100% within each iteration: this can become tiring for both developers and designers. Luckily, building a tight knit relationship with our client allows us to reevaluate and modify processes as needed.
- (Initial) Difficulty onboarding new team members

Conclusion
----------------------------------------------
Working on a large software and design system can be a challenging and rewarding task.

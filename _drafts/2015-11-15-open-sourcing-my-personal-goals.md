In the summer of 2014, I interned as a UX Designer at Viget in Boulder, CO. It was that summer that I (virtually) met fellow intern Una Kravets, who was interning as a front-end developer at Viget's HQ in Falls Church, VA. 

Since our paths crossed, I've been following her work (she's pretty awesome and one of the hardest workers I know), and saw her begin open sourcing her personal goals, both as a way to keep herself accountable and as a means of inspiring others to do the same.

Well, I was inspired. Often times, it's difficult to stay disciplined when it comes to what you want to do outside of your normal 9-5 workday. Did you finally read that book on product design techniques? What about that yoga class you've been meaning to get to for 4 months? It's hard. We all find ourselves busy with work and life and more often than not, it's easier to put off the small things that you've been meaning to get done.

It's now week three of me having open sourced my goals. I've Una's GitHub repo and am working to make it my own. While I still have a ways to go in organize what I want to do, it's definitely a start and has got me thinking about the mini accomplishments that can be made each and every day.

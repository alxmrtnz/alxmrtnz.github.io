## Project Overview
At <a href="https://whitelabelco.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Whitelabel</a>, we worked with a client to create <a href="https://maptastic.us/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Maptastic</a>, a React web application that makes U.S. demographic data, such as population, housing characteristics, and related socioeconomic characteristics easily obtainable to local governments, nonprofits, and regional planning agencies.

### My Role
Working in collaboration with our lead designer and several backend developers, I served as the lead front-end developer on Maptastic.

The project allowed me to try out new libraries like <a href="https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Chartist.js</a>, used to display data obtained through <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">U.S. Census APIs</a>, and explore the Google Maps API and Geosuggest (through libraries like <a href="https://github.com/ubilabs/react-geosuggest" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">React Geosuggest</a>) for geolocation searches.

I was able to create a responsive and flexible layout using SASS, Flexbox, and libraries like <a href="https://github.com/glennflanagan/react-collapsible" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">React Collapsible</a> and used Redux for local component data interaction.

### A Flexible, Responsive Layout
In order to achieve layouts for multiple devices, I used Flexbox to create a responsive masonry-style layout. Each card, representing different data points, needed to maintain a minimum width for data to be digestible, but also had to be flexible enough to re-stack on smaller devices.

  </div>
  <span class="img-caption">
    Users can easily switch between editing multiple athletes profile.
  </span>
</div>

Additionally, on desktop, we wanted to keep the map in a fixed position so that users could scroll through the cards of data on the right, but always have easy access to the map to refine their search radius.

  Conclusion &amp; Lessons Learned
</h2>

While concise in scope, Maptastic helped me explore new terrain. From learning how interact with and customize map elements with Google Maps to styling large chunks of data using Chartist, this project exposed me to new front-end features. Front-end development continues to excite me as I discover how much more there is to learn every day.

Over seventy-five years ago, Prohibition was repealed in the United States and once again beer was sold openly to the public. 

What's hard to believe is that after all of that time, while almost every other state in our nation embraces consumer convenience, Pennsylvania is still no closer to reforming Prohibition-era beer laws. 

Ultimately, this means you still can't buy a six-pack of beer conveniently in Pennsylvania. 

<a href="http://www.freemybeer.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Free My Beer</a> is an advocacy group that supports any proposed legislation that would allow convenience and grocery stores to sell beer in the same fashion as restaurants and taverns and they came to us to design and develop their platform's website. 


Designing for the Keystone State
-------------
I served as the principal visual designer for the project. After evaluating project goals with our client, I was able to assess that from in terms of a visual language, the site needed to reference the past while looking to the future.

I used a mix of historical photography, Pennsylvania-themed symbolism (it's the Keystone State, after all!), and bold typography that referenced Prohibition-era newspapers, to connect the past with the future and the state of Pennsylvania with this ever-important issue.

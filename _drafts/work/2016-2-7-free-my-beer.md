The <a href="http://www.fosi.org/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Family Online Safety Institute</a> (FOSI) came to <a href="http://www.isl.co/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">ISL</a> to redesign and rebuild their website. Our mission was twofold â€”to combine fosi.org and aplaftormforgood.org (now Good Digital Parenting) under one umbrella, and to create a beautiful design and a user friendly experience


Over seventy-five years ago, Prohibition was repealed in the United States and once again beer was sold openly to the public. What's hard to believe is that after all of that time, while almost every other state in our nation embraces consumer convenience, Pennsylvania is still no closer to reforming Prohibition-era beer laws. 

Ultimately, this means you still can't buy a six-pack of beer conveniently in Pennsylvania. Free My Beer is an advocacy group that supports any proposed legislation that would allow convenience and grocery stores to sell beer in the same fashion as restaurants and taverns. 

Sign the petition here to help support HB 466 and bring beer convenience to the masses.

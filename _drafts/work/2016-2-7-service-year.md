Project Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Service Year Alliance teamed up with <a href='http://isl.co/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">ISL</a> to design and develop a digital platform for young Americans to connect and serve with the nation's best nonprofits. Service Year aims to make a year of service a common expectation and opportunity for every young American.

An ongoing and ever-evolving project, the site brings the nation's best service opportunities into one place, allowing both organizations and service corps members to more easily connect with one another.

As of this writing (July 2016), the Service Year platform has registered over 500 service members, 260 organizations, and over 800 service opportunities.


- Stats (verify these with Chad):
-- 260 Orgs
-- 520 Corps Members
-- 560 Listings
-- 120 serving corps members


## My Role

Over the course of the project, I worked with several other designers and touched many aspects of the platform. From conducting initial user research to iterating on variouinformation architecture and user flows and also worked closely with our team's UX lead on various user flows, wireframes, user testing, and design refinement.

Now in its second year, Service Year has been an ever-evolving project that I have been involved in. I work with a small team of designers and developers in an iterative agile workflow.

From user research to diagraming the information architecture and user flows of various processes, I have touched many parts of the Service Year platform in terms of both visual and UX design.



## User Experience

One of the biggest of this project is the management of various user and content types and determining how they interact with one another.

The platform needs to cater to a variety of different user types:

- **Organization Administrators** that manage an organization
- **Organization Users** that post and recruit for individual service opportunities
- **Individuals** searching for and serving in service opportunities

Designing the nation's largest collection 
Service Year is the nation's largest single collection of year long service opportunities. 

- Talk about how big the platform really is
-- Made up of Corps Members (users looking for service opportunities), Organization Users (that create positions, listings for opportunities, and search for CMs), and Admins (the team that manages the orgs and user in the system).
-- All three of these user types interact with their own unique dashboard and mapping the flows of different interactions, models, and objects can prove a difficult challenge, especially with the need to certify various things that orgs post (positions and whatnot)

### Creating the Service Year Ecosystem

Talk about shaping their process, from signing up to profile creation to finding and being matched with an organization and then documenting their service journey. 

-- Here, highlight the CM profile that changes over time as a CM progresses through their year(s) of service

- Organizations
Talk about positions and listings and the challenge of creating a job posting site that kind of works like a job listing site but not really

- Search
Talk about solving complexity around searching for the different types of content on the SY platform to allow various user types to find what they need.


### Prototyping and Testing

Talk about using <a href='http://invisionapp.com/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Invision</a> for prototyping user flows of various interactions.

## Interface Design

General Summary

### A Living Styleguide
Talk about challenges with designing for a large-scale web application. Style guides have long been a staple of print and web design. Today, web style guides and design systems are a trending topic.

While web style guides and frameworks have been around for several years, the explosion of large-scale web applications has brought about an extra focus on creating design systems. Style guides like Salesforce's <a href='https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Lightning Design System</a> or Dropbox's <a href='http://dropbox.github.io/scooter/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Scooter</a> have set a standard for the design community.

Style guides and design systems are the product of convergence of design and development. They provide designers a source of truth for components and guidelines to work from and also allow developers to build faster and more accurately.

### Iteration



Working in Agile
-----------------------------
- Talk about our Agile process. It's evolved over time as both the design and development team have discovered things that work and don't work. 

- Talk about going from a single unified sprint to split sprints, back to a unified sprint



Lessons Learned
---------------
- Agile
- Large system planning is more difficult than meets the eye
- Working both with a small (design) team and large (whole) team
- Learning how to fail, recognize the failure, and make changes to improve moving forward

Conclusion
SY is an ongoing and ever evolving project that aims to become the nation's leader in national service opportunities

###User Flows
These fictional personas allowed us to create user flows that aided in the identification of discrete goals and actions for each type of user.

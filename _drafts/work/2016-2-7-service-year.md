Project Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Service Year Alliance teamed up with <a href='http://sketchtoolbox.com/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">ISL</a> to design and develop a digital platform for young Americans to connect and serve with the nation's best nonprofits. Service Year aims to make a year of service a common expectation and opportunity for every young American.

An ongoing and ever-evolving project, the site brings the nation's best service opportunities into one place, allowing both organizations and service members to more easily connect with one another.

My Role
-------
On the Service Year project, I served as the lead visual designer and also worked closely with our team's UX lead on various user flows, wireframes, user testing, and design refinement.

I designed various public facing pages, user flows, and established a style guide that serves as a source of truth for the project's many design tasks â€“- documenting everything from buttons to forms to type.


The Service Year Universe
------------------
One of the biggest of this project is the management of various user and content types and determining how they interact with one another.

The platform needed to cater to three various user types:
- Organization administrators that manage the org entity
- Organization users that manage recruitment for individual listings
- Individuals searching and serving in service opportunities

Designing the nation's largest collection 
Service Year is the nation's largest single collection of year long service opportunities. 

- Talk about how big the platform really is
-- Made up of Corps Members (users looking for service opportunities), Organization Users (that create positions, listings for opportunities, and search for CMs), and Admins (the team that manages the orgs and user in the system).
-- All three of these user types interact with their own unique dashboard and mapping the flows of different interactions, models, and objects can prove a difficult challenge, especially with the need to certify various things that orgs post (positions and whatnot)

- Corps Members
Talk about shaping their process, from signing up to profile creation to finding and being matched with an organization and then documenting their service journey. 
-- Here, highlight the CM profile that changes over time as a CM progresses through their year(s) of service

- Organizations
Talk about positions and listings and the challenge of creating a job posting site that kind of works like a job listing site but not really

- Search
Talk about solving complexity around searching for the different types of content on the SY platform to allow various user types to find what they need.


User Centered Design

Prototyping and Testing 
-----------------------

Agile Iteration
-----------------------------
- Talk about our Agile process. It's evolved over time as both the design and development team have discovered things that work and don't work. 
- Talk about going from a single unified sprint to split sprints, back to a unified sprint



Lessons Learned
---------------
- Agile
- Large system planning is more difficult than meets the eye
- Working both with a small (design) team and large (whole) team
- Learning how to fail, recognize the failure, and make changes to improve moving forward

Conclusion
SY is an ongoing and ever evolving project that aims to become the nation's leader in national service opportunities

###User Flows
These fictional personas allowed us to create user flows that aided in the identification of discrete goals and actions for each type of user.

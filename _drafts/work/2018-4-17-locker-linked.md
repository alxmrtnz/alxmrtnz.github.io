## Project Overview
Every year, thousands of high school athletes look to pursue their passion at the next level and begin a process of trying to find the perfect athletic and academic fit. Having never gone through the college athletic recruiting process, these students, and their parents, are often in uncharted waters.

Which coaches should they talk to? How do they gain the right exposure? Which program should they choose... and why? Even with the best work ethic and determination, every athlete could use a little help.

As part of the team at <a href="https://whitelabelco.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Whitelabel</a>, I helped build the digital platform for <a href="https://www.lockerlinked.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Locker Linked</a>, a startup that aims to provide student athletes with first-rate recruitment network services and tools to prepare them for upcoming college athletic opportunities.

Locker Linked simplifies the recruitment process, allowing student athletes to set up a player profile to showcase skills, connect directly with coaches and recruiters, and get exclusive access to essential resources to maximize potential recruitment.

## My Role
While my team at Whitelabel worked closely with Locker Linked to design and build their entire platform, from design to development, I worked specifically on the development team focusing on building the front-end of the platform in React.

The app is built with React and Redux on the front-end, integrates with <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Stripe</a> for user payment, and connects to a Rails backend. I worked closely with our lead backend developer to build a component-based UI that hooked up seamlessly with our backend database and architecture.

## Creating a Showcase for Athletes
### The Intricacies of Profile Management
1) Talk about how Parents, Athletes and Coaches could all sign up and manage a profile
This necessitated a complex onboarding process (which also had social auth)

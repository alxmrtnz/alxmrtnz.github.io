::User Experience, Visual Design

<!-- A website redesign for fosi.org that combines industry news, resources, and events with a new platform, Good Digital Parenting. The Family Online Safety Institute is an international, non-profit organization which works to make the online world safer for kids and their families. Our intended audiences were K-12 families, policy-makers, and industry professionals. -->

Project Overview
----------------------------------------------
The <a href="http://www.fosi.org/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Family Online Safety Institute</a> (FOSI) came to <a href="http://www.isl.co/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">ISL</a> to redesign and rebuild their website. Our mission was twofold â€”to combine fosi.org and aplaftormforgood.org (now Good Digital Parenting) under one umbrella, and to create a beautiful design and a user friendly experience

The redesign process involved diving deep into Google Analytics, conducting user testing with key audiences, and unifying the two sites through detailed wireframing and design.

Working closely with our client, we successfully created a digital hub for online safety news, research, and events. With a focus on information architecture and design, the project aimed to reorganize content and present it in a digestible, mobile-friendly format.

	<h2>
		Understanding the Audience
	</h2>
	<p>
		The new fosi.org was a challenge due to its wide range of intended audiences. In addition to online safety information for families, the site needed to cater to a variety of individuals from professionals seeking out industry conferences and events to  policy makers that utilize FOSI's many research articles in everyday work.
	</p>

	<h3>
		Personas
	</h3>
	<p>
		In order to better understand each type of user, we created a variety personas to serve as references throughout the design process. By working closely with the FOSI team, we were able to ensure that the personas accurately reflected their intended audiences. We could then use these personas as a reference for any debates or decisions throughout the process.

		<div class="grid__item grid__item--half end">
		    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/work/fosi/persona-mary.jpg">
		</div> 
	</div>

	<h3>
		User Flows
	</h3>
	<p>
		 These fictional personas allowed us to create user flows that aided in the identification of discrete goals and actions for each type of user.
	</p>

	    </div>
	</div>

	<h2>
		Site Structure
	</h2> 
	<p>
		After analyzing user flows and also interviewing stakeholders, we reorganized content into three main buckets:
	</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>
			Family Resources (Good Digital Parenting)
		</li>
		<li>
			Policy and Research
		</li>
		<li>
			Events
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Concentrating of FOSI's pre-existing content into three main buckets simplified the process of finding content for the end user. Not only that, but the structure allowed us to make content a priority something something here...</p>

##Prototyping
Some of the functionality we wanted to include in the site, such as a sticky navigation and fixed filters, are often difficult to describe to clients using static wireframes. To better communicate the small details that would improve the new FOSI experience, our team created a set of animated wireframes in addition to our standard wireframe set.

Visual Design
----------------------------------------------

###Typography
In order to be inviting to parents, yet authoritative and reliable to professionals, I chose typefaces that mixed organic sans-serif headings with more traditional serifed text.

<div class="grid">
	<div class="grid__item grid__item--full">
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/work/fosi/fosi-type-example.jpg" alt="">
	</div>
</div>

####Aaux Next
Aaux Next is an approachabe sans-serif that was chosen for headings due to its mix of solid structure and rounded, more quirky, characteristics.

####Minion Pro
Minion Pro exhibits functional qualities that makes text highly readable. I chose it to give formality and legibility to the site's main content.


###Colors
With content being broken up into several main sections, I defined colors that would be related to each type of content (green for Good Digital Parenting, red for Policy & Research, etc). By tying specific colors to content, we were able to visually separate internal platforms each internal platform and give the user clear context to their location on the site.

		A Flexible, Responsive Publishing Platform
	</h2>

	<p>
		At its core, the new FOSI.org is a multi-faceted publishing platform. From online-safety print outs to the latest research on internet privacy, FOSI works to publish educational content that helps families (and the industry at large) learn and grow in the new digital age. 
	</p>
	<p>
		By creating flexible layouts, a new design system, and an integration with Wagtail, a Django-based CMS, we were able to provide FOSI with a rethought and redesigned responsive experience.

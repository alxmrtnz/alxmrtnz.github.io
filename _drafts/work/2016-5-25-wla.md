Project Overview
-----------------
The Washington Leadership Academy is a public charter school working to change the way we think about high school education. With a mission to provide sutdents in the District of Columbia with the knowledge, skills and habits required for success in college and lives of public leadership, WLA came to our team at <a href="http://www.isl.co/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">ISL</a> for a branding and website overhaul.

The project presented our team with a unique opportunity to create a site from the ground up on Squarespace, design and build a client project in the open, give back to our local community, and help lead the way for a new kind high school education.


Creating a Modular Design System
--------------------------------

In order to create custom Squarespace site that would be easily customizeable and maintainable in the future, our team crafted a set of reusable and modular components. 


### Wireframing and Prototyping
In order to rapidly wireframe and prototype (due to the tight project timeline), I created wireframes using a set of several repeated components.

Collaboration with <a href="http://heyitsolivia.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Olivia Cheng</a>, our lead developer on the project, made it clear that we could use the Squarespace as a CMS to implement these components and provide WLA with a more flexible and customizable end experience.

### Visual Design

As I worked through the IA/UX of the project, my colleague <a href="http://www.dribbble.com/thepaleshadow/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">James Bonilla</a> simultaneously worked with WLA to create a brand for their online and offline presence. 

In addition to incorporating the James's branding into the site, it was at this time that I focused on the responsive design of each individual component.

Designing & Developing in the Open
-----------------------
It's not often that a client is as forward-thinking as the Washington Leadership Academy. With approval from their team, we were able to open source both the design and development of the project on <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Github</a>.

Our initial goal was to use Github as an internal tool for collaboration but it also ended up allowing our team to document design and development decisions for future contributors to the project.

### The Tools We Used

- Github
- Waffle.io

Because our mantra in building this site was "reusable components," we used Github's issues feature to track each individual component all the way from wireframe to development.

In addition, we integrated our Github repository with <a href="http://waffle.io/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Waffle.io</a>. Using Github issues and Waffle allowed us to create a Kanban board to track progress and colloborate on each feature.


### Documentation
If we didn't love Github enough already, we even took advantage of Github's wiki functionality to create and delivered a <a href="https://github.com/washington-leadership-academy/wla/wiki/WLA-Squarespace-User-Guide" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">user guide</a> to WLA for future reference.

This iterative, Kanban style process made it easy for our team to track design and development progress and effectively meet a tight deadline.

Project Overview
-----------------
The Washington Leadership Academy is a public charter school working to change the way we think about high school education. With a mission to provide sutdents in the District of Columbia with the knowledge, skills and habits required for success in college and lives of public leadership, WLA came to our team at <a href="http://www.isl.co/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">ISL</a> for a branding and website overhaul.

The project presented our team with a unique opportunity to create a site from the ground up on Squarespace, design and build a client project in the open, give back to our local community, and help lead the way for a new kind high school education.


Creating a Modular Design System
--------------------------------

In order to create custom Squarespace site that would be easily customizeable and maintainable in the future, our team set out to craft a set of reusable and modular components. 

Designing and building in components would enabled us to think of the site block by block instead of page by page and in turn, creating greater future flexibility for the WLA team.


### Wireframing and Prototyping
- Initially set out to create a set of 4-5 template pages, each with their own purpose/use. However, it quickly became clear that creating a set of moveable modules would allow for greater custimization down the line.
- We held several internal wireframing workshops. Including one where we identified the most important reusable blocks, cut them out, and documented them using Github issues
- Allowed us to account for a variety of modules and convey to the client how they would fit together. 
- Next, we put together an Invision prototype of the wireframes to show the client how the different components could come together in a page

### Documentation
Sketch, Photoshop, Omnigraffle, Illustrator, Balsamiq... the list goes on and on. It's a bit too easy to jump straight into your favorite design tool and start cranking out wireframes for a project without assessing the real needs of the site.

The excercise we found most useful was printing out and then cutting apart wireframes to determine which components to keep and which to toss. Then, in order to keep track of each component, both for future visual design and development, we photographed each and saved it as an issue on Github.





Visual Design
----------------------
Our team was presented with a set of exciting challenges. It's not often that a client With the WLA website, our team had the opportunity to explore three things that aren't often explored on client projects:

1. Create for good (pro bono work)
2. Create a custom site using Squarespace
3. Design and build in the open


Designing (& Developing) in the Open
-----------------------

### The Tools We Used

- Github
- Waffle
- Invision


Brand Creation
-------------
My colleague <a href="http://www.dribbble.com/thepaleshadow/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">James Bonilla</a> worked closely with WLA to create the brand for both online and offline prescence. Participating in internal critiques and sessions with the client, I lent support for the branding process in order to create a cohesion between the brand and the website itself.



Key Takeaways
-------------------------------------
Through the entire process

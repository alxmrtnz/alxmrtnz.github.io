<a href="http://www.theoutlookgroup.com/" target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">The Outlook Group</a> is one of the nation's largest marketing firms in the preneed* funeral industry and has a national team of sales representatives who work with individual funeral homes to maintain and develop their own customer bases.

I worked with the group and a small team to create the Outlook Relationship Management System (ORMS), a web application that improves the workflow of The Outlook Group's sales representatives and client funeral homes. 

I focused on establishing the overall visual language and user experience of the platform and also worked closely with project developers throughout implementation.

<p class="footnote">
  * Preneed services include things such as preneed life insurance policies that cover the cost of predetermined expense of a funeral, cremation, or burial.

## Identifying Product Needs

Because The Outlook Group has a national team of sales representatives who work with individual funeral homes, the group wanted us to develop a tool for their team to help clients maintain and develop their own customer base.

After conversations with The Outlook Group and an analysis of their team structure, we identified the core product features that would not only provide benefit to the end user, but also fit into the workflow of the company as a whole.

 : 

* **Contact Management**
	* To allow for recording potential customers and moving them through the acquisition funnel
* **Filtering and Tagging**
	* To monitor and evaluate customers
* **Calendar Integration**
	* To allow sales representatives to record interactions and meetings with customers
* **System Administration**
	* The creation of a centralized hub for system administrators to manage sales representatives

Notes, categorize notes and create a timeline to track each individual lead

Problem
Turnover is
From the very beginning, we want to monitor everything because leads could stay in the system for multiple years
Baby boomers are those being tracked, either for the person or their loved ones

Due to nature of leads, needed long term tracking

###User Flows
These fictional personas allowed us to create user flows that aided in the identification of discrete goals and actions for each type of user.

</div>

##Site Structure
After analyzing user flows and also interviewing stakeholders, we reorganized content into three main buckets:

1. Family Resources (Good digital Parenting)
2. Policy and Research
3. Events

Concentrating of FOSI's pre-existing content into three main buckets simplified the process of finding content for the end user. Not only that, but the structure allowed us to make content a priority something something here...

##Prototyping
Some of the functionality we wanted to include in the site, such as a sticky navigation and fixed filters, are often difficult to describe to clients using static wireframes. To better communicate the small details that would improve the new FOSI experience, our team created a set of animated wireframes in addition to our standard wireframe set.

Visual Design
----------------------------------------------

###Typography
In order to be inviting to parents, yet authoritative and reliable to professionals, I chose typefaces that mixed organic sans-serif headings with more traditional serifed text.

	<div class="grid__item grid__item--full">
		<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/work/fosi/fosi-type-example.jpg" alt="">
	</div>
</div>

####Aaux Next
Aaux Next is an approachabe sans-serif that was chosen for headings due to its mix of solid structure and rounded, more quirky, characteristics.

####Minion Pro
Minion Pro exhibits functional qualities that makes text highly readable. I chose it to give formality and legibility to the site's main content.


###Colors
With content being broken up into several main sections, I defined colors that would be related to each type of content (green for Good Digital Parenting, red for Policy & Research, etc). By tying specific colors to content, we were able to visually separate internal platforms each internal platform and give the user clear context to their location on the site.

	A Flexible, Responsive Publishing Platform
</h2>

At its core, the new FOSI.org is a multi-faceted publishing platform. From online-safety print outs to the latest research on internet privacy, FOSI works to publish educational content that helps families (and the industry at large) learn and grow in the new digital age. 
		
By creating flexible layouts, a new design system, and an integration with Wagtail, a Django-based CMS, we were able to provide FOSI with a rethought and redesigned responsive experience.

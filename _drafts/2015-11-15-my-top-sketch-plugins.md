You know what's awesome about Sketch? Quite a lot of things. One of my favorites? Plugins.

Before I switched over from Photoshop to Sketch as my primary web design tool, I had used Photoshop plugins. However, I often found myself frustrated with how to find, download, install, and generally configure them to get them to do what I wanted. With Sketch, it's a breeze. 

But First... Sketch Toolbox
----------------------------------------------
Before we dive into my favorite plugins, if you use Sketch and you haven't installed <a href='http://sketchtoolbox.com/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Sketch Toolbox</a> yet, prepare to get excited. Sketch Toolbox is an amazing application created by members of the Sketch community that lets you easily manage your Sketch plugins.

It does three HUGE things for you:

1. Lets you browse the most popular plugins available for Sketch 
	- Sketch Toolbox connects directly to GitHub repositories of the latest plugins generated by members of the Sketch community
2. Downloads and installs new plugins with a single click
	- No more downloading and moving plugin files around within your app directories. One-click-install and you're done
3. Automatically keeps all your plugins up to date
	- Being connected to a plugin's GitHub repo means that Sketch Toolbox can simply download the latest sourcecode and keep you up to date

After you've got Sketch Toolbox installed, you'll be rolling with plugins in no time. And now, some of my favorite plugins:

1) Sketch Measure
----------------------------------------------

2) Dynamic Buttons
----------------------------------------------




Whether it’s designing a logo for the project, contributing source code, or just adding to the conversation, find the thing you’re most passionate about and contribute. There are also some <a href='http://opendesign.foundation/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">great</a> <a href='https://github.com/opensourcedesign' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">places</a> you can go to get started.

Side Projects are Stupid… and They’re Supposed to Be
----------------------------------------------------
I had been looking forward to being introduced to <a href='https://twitter.com/schneidertobias' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Tobias van Schneider</a> (and his luscious beard) for some time. Tobias is a German-born designer that recently led the Spotify brand refresh.

His talk focused on how keeping side projects focused around fun and stupid ideas helps us from freezing up and over thinking about our work. From <a href='http://authenticweather.com/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Authentic Weather</a> to his own <a href='http://www.beardbrand.com/products/black-marble-beard-oil' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">line of beard oil</a>, Tobias has always thought small instead and followed through on some downright silly ideas that have turned into (sometimes viral) side projects. Some guiding principles for successful side projects? Let yourself be stupid, ignore everybody (they all have their own ideas and opinions of how things should be), trust your gut, and stay busy.

Web Accessibility is More than Accessible Code
----------------------------------------------
As practitioners of web design and development, it’s our job to make our websites usable, visually pleasing, and accessible – and that doesn’t mean just developers/engineers implementing accessible code. 

<a href='https://twitter.com/Jennison' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">Jennison Asuncion</a>, Co-Director of the Adaptech Research Network, spoke about how producing accessible content means designing and developing user experiences that everyone, including people with disabilities, can independently consume and interact with. From touching on resources for <a href='http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">sufficient color contrast</a> to walking us through the experience of using a screenreader on <a href='https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/?root=1' target="_blank" class="link--text-in-p">United.com</a>, Jennison got me thinking about how web professionals can (and should) improve accessibility across their work.

For a first web conference experience, it was a blast and extremely inspiring. If you’re a web professional or have just been thinking about putting yourself out there and learning how we creatives can help impact the world around us, I’d recommend attending a conference like FOWD. I’m already planning my next steps of finding and contributing to an open source project, working to make my sites more accessible, and might even be thinking about my own beard oil… well, we’ll see about that last one. Now get out there and get learning!

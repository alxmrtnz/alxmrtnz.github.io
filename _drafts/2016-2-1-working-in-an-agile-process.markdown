From building a car to producing a website, the waterfall method has long been one of the most popular processes for production industries. Comprised of a discrete series of steps completed in succession, one could say that waterfall is the production line of processes of all work processes.

In theory, the waterfall method is efficient. There is a clear start and finish to each phase of a project and everyone is on the same page. 

In the realm of digital products, where MVPs (minimum vialable products), user testing, and iteration are used to gauge the success of new features and produce a road map for the product itself, the waterfall method has its flaws. A lack of collaboration and communication between teams members due to a segmented waterfall process can lead to miscommunication, a less successful project, and overall sadness.

Enter Agile 
--------------
A newer methodology, the agile process, aims to fix some of the problems caused by is a process created by software engineers in the early 2000â€™s that helps teams design, build, and iterate faster than ever before.

It's place on Service Year (2 short paragraphs)
----------------------------------------------
- brief overview of Service Year
- history of methods
-- always been agile, but being ISL's first large scale application build, our process has also gone through many iterations and is always evolving
-- Sprints broken up by team at first, then alternated, now together
- Determination of Resources, LOE-ing:

Advantages
----------------------------------------------
- Ability to identify problems and change methods
- Shorter lifecycles for features means being able to refine them over time
- Opportunity to learn, change, and grow, both as individuals and team members

Disadvantages
----------------------------------------------
- Quick turnaround time for each sprint can often lead to a lack of documentation (style guide) and sometimes miscommunication
- Many many meetings: In order to plan and execute each two-week sprint, there are many meetings both internally and with our client. 
- The need to really complete each feature 100% within each iteration: this can become tiring for both developers and designers. Luckily, building a tight knit relationship with our client allows us to reevaluate and modify processes as needed.
- (Initial) Difficulty onboarding new team members

Conclusion
----------------------------------------------
Working on a large software and design system can be a challenging and rewarding task.

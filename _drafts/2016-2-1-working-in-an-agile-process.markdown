Definition of Agile
----------------------------------------------

It's place on Service Year (2 short paragraphs)
----------------------------------------------
- brief overview of Service Year
- history of methods
-- always been agile, but being ISL's first large scale application build, our process has also gone through many iterations and is always evolving
-- Sprints broken up by team at first, then alternated, now together
- Determination of Resources, LOE-ing:

Advantages
----------------------------------------------
- Ability to identify problems and change methods
- Shorter lifecycles for features means being able to refine them over time
- Opportunity to learn, change, and grow, both as individuals and team members

Disadvantages
----------------------------------------------
- Quick turnaround time for each sprint can often lead to a lack of documentation (style guide) and sometimes miscommunication
- Many many meetings: In order to plan and execute each two-week sprint, there are many meetings both internally and with our client. 
- The need to really complete each feature 100% within each iteration: this can become tiring for both developers and designers. Luckily, building a tight knit relationship with our client allows us to reevaluate and modify processes as needed.
- (Initial) Difficulty onboarding new team members

Conclusion
----------------------------------------------
Working on a large software and design system can be a challenging and rewarding task.
